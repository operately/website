## Work Map: See everything at a glance

First, let's explore the new Work Map – your bird's-eye view of all ongoing work
in your company.

The Work Map gives you a clear view of goals and projects
organized in a parent-child structure. You can see how high-level initiatives
break down into smaller goals and projects, and how individual pieces of work
contribute to broader company strategy.

The new work-map comes with a new quick-add feature that allows you to quickly create
goals and projects.

Whether you're setting up quarterly goals or sketching out a year-long roadmaps,
Quick Add keeps you in the zone. Create goals and projects on the spot, then
organize them exactly where they belong in your work structure. No need to
navigate between different screens or interrupt your planning flow.

## New Profile Pages

The work-map view is also available on the profile pages.

The new Profile Pages provide a complete view of each team members' work and
contributions. See what someone is working on, what they're reviewing, what
they've completed.

Your own profile is available from "My work" in the top navigation. This unified
experience makes it easier to understand responsibilities, track progress, and
compare workloads across the team. It fosters transparency and alignment since
everyone sees the same information in the same way.

## Redesigned Goal Page

Next, let's explore the new goal page which brings everything you need into a single,
organized view.

See the description, targets, and all connected subgoals and projects
in one place. The redesigned layout makes it easy to track what's working, what
needs attention, and who's responsible for each piece of work.

Check-ins, discussions, and activity feed directly into the goal page, so you
always have the full context of progress, decisions, and risks on your goals.

## Project Discussions: Collaborate where the work happens

Finally, let's jump to a project to explore the new project discussions.

Every project now has dedicated Project Discussions.

this allows you to Have focused conversations about project scope, decisions,
blockers, and updates right where the work is happening.

No more hunting through chat threads or email chains – everything you need to
know about a project lives right there with the project itself.
