## We're confident to call it v1.0

The jump from v0.4 to v1.0.0 isn't just about version numbers. It marks our transition from experimental releases to a stable, feature-rich platform ready for wider adoption. This milestone reflects our commitment to reliability, usability, and delivering the core features that teams need to manage work at scale.

## Work Map: See everything at a glance

First, let's explore the new Work Map – your bird's-eye view of all ongoing work in your company.

The Work Map gives you a clear, hierarchical view of goals and projects organized in a parent-child structure. You can see how high-level objectives break down into smaller goals and projects, and how individual pieces of work contribute to broader company priorities.

For example, a top-level company goal might have several subgoals, each with their own projects. The Work Map displays these relationships visually, making it easy to trace progress from the smallest project up to your company's main objectives.

You have two views: the Company Work Map shows everything across your entire organization, while Space Work Maps focus on specific teams. Both include filtering tabs, progress indicators, status badges, and owner information – all updating in real-time as work progresses.

## Quick Add: Map out your quarter in minutes

Planning just got simpler with Quick Add, built right into the Work Map.

Whether you're setting up quarterly goals or sketching out a year-long roadmap, Quick Add keeps you in the zone. Create goals and projects on the spot, then organize them exactly where they belong in your work structure. No need to navigate between different screens or interrupt your planning flow.

---

## Project Discussions: Collaborate where the work happens

Every project now has dedicated Project Discussions.

Have focused conversations about project scope, decisions, blockers, and updates right where the work is happening. Project Discussions keep context close to the work, making it easier for team members to stay informed and contribute meaningfully to project success.

No more hunting through chat threads or email chains – everything you need to know about a project lives right there with the project itself.

---

## Redesigned Goal Page

The new Goal Page brings everything you need into a single, organized view.

See your goal description, targets with real-time values, and all connected subgoals and projects in one place. The redesigned layout makes it easy to track what's working, what needs attention, and who's responsible for each piece of work.

Check-ins, discussions, and activity feed directly into the goal page, so you always have the full context of progress and decisions.

---

## New Profile Pages

The new Profile Pages provide a complete view of each team member's work and contributions.

See what someone is working on, what they're reviewing, what they've completed, and their recent activity – all in one place. The page highlights assigned work, progress indicators, due dates, and next steps for each person.

Your own profile is available from "My work" in the top navigation. This unified experience makes it easier to understand responsibilities, track progress, and compare workloads across the team. It fosters transparency and alignment since everyone sees the same information in the same way.

---

## Streamlined Workflows

We've refined the core workflows that teams use every day by addressing pain points from earlier versions.

**Unified Statuses**: We've aligned statuses for both goals and projects. This consistent approach makes it easy to scan all work at a glance and understand progress across your organization.

**Simplified Goal Creation**: No more overwhelming forms. The new process guides you step-by-step, focusing on essentials: the goal name and which team is responsible. You can fill in additional details later, making it easier to get started.

**Focused Check-Ins**: Check-ins are now straightforward. Answer three things: What's the status? Is the due date still accurate? How's progress? No hunting for info, no back-and-forth. Everyone gets a clear, honest update in seconds.
