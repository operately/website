# Tools

These are the software tools that we use at Operately to get work done.

## Operately

We believe in eating our own dog food. We use Operately to run our company,
set goals, manage projects, communicate, and track progress. Operately is the
hub of our operations and the source of truth for all things related to the
company.

## Discord

We use Discord for team communication, chat, and watercooler conversations.
Discord is where we hang out, share memes, and have fun. We have different
channels for different topics, projects, and teams. Discord is the place where
we build relationships, share knowledge, and have fun.

## Semaphore

We use Semaphore for continuous integration and deployment. Semaphore is where
we run our tests, build our code, and deploy to production. It is a trusted
gatekeeper that ensures that only high-quality code reaches our users.

## GitHub

We use GitHub for version control, code reviews, and collaboration. GitHub is
where we store and review our code. It is the place to meet our contributors,
collaborate on projects, and build software together.

## Whimsical

We use Whimsical for wireframing, flowcharts, and diagrams. Whimsical is where
we design our user interfaces, map out our processes, and visualize our ideas.
It is a creative space where we bring our ideas to life and share them with
others.

## Google Workspace

We use Google Workspace for email, calendar, and documents. Google Meet is
where we have standups, meetings, and calls.
