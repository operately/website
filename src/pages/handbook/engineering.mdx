# Engineering

Engineers at Operately are responsible for building and maintaing Operately's products.
This includes the Operately the product, the Operately website, the Operately cloud
infrastructure, and any other products that Operately may build in the future.

## Scope of work

We hire full-stack engineers, who are willing to work on the front-end, back-end, mobile,
and cloud infrastructure, or to acquire the skills to do so. Full-stack engineers allow
us to move faster, focus on the complete user experience, and to build products that
are robust and scalable.

It is normal to have deeper expertise in one area, and to consult with others when
working on a different area. For example, if you are a have deeper expertise in the
front-end, you may consult with others when optimizing a database query, or setting
up cloud infrastructure.

## Responsibilities

- **Product development**: Build and maintain Operately's products.
- **Architecture design**: Design the architecture of the product/features you build.
- **Code quality**: Write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
- **Code reviews**: Review code from other engineers and open source contributors.
- **Testing**: Write tests for your code, and for the code of others.
- **Documentation**: Write documentation for the features you build, or the architecture you design.
- **Collaboration**: Work with other engineers, designers, product managers to build products.
- **Learning**: Keep up-to-date with the latest technologies, and best practices in software engineering.
- **Mentoring**: Mentor junior engineers, and help open source contributors to contribute to Operately.
- **On-call**: Participate in the on-call rotation, and respond to incidents when they happen.
- **Security**: Design and build secure products, and follow best practices in security.
- **Performance**: Measure and optimize the performance of the products you build.
- **Release management**: Deploy code to production, and monitor the performance of the products you build.
- **Interviewing**: Interview candidates for engineering roles.
- **Task management**: Manage your tasks, and communicate your progress to the team.

## Technologies

Operately is built with the following technologies:

### Elixir

Elixir is the main programming language we use at Operately. Elixir is a functional
programming language, built on top of the Erlang VM. Elixir is used to build the
backend of Operately, including the API, Email, Websockets, and other services.

### TypeScript

We use TypeScript to build the front-end of Operately. TypeScript is a typed superset
of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. We believe that TypeScript helps
us write more robust code, and to catch bugs early in the compilation phase.

### React

React is the main front-end library we use at Operately. React is a JavaScript library
for building user interfaces. React is used to build the complete web experience of
the application.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the main database we use at Operately. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source
object-relational database system. PostgreSQL is used to store the data of Operately,
including user data, product data, and other data.

### Linux

Linux is the main operating system we use at Operately for deploying our products.
You should have a strong understanding of Linux, Bash, and the command line.

### Docker

We use docker both in development and production. Docker is a tool designed to make
it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. It eliminates
"works on my machine" problems when collaborating on code with others.

### Semaphore

We use Semaphore CI as the main gatekeeper for quality, including continuous integration
and continuous deployment. Semaphore is used to run tests, build artifacts, deploy code,
and verify the quality of the code.
