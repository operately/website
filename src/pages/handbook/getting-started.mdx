## About Operately

Operatelyâ€™s mission is to empower every startup to execute at the highest level. 

We recognize that while startup founders are brilliant innovators, they often 
struggle with the operational challenges of building a company. At Operately, we 
provide the systems and tools needed to streamline execution, maintain focus, and 
boost information flow.

By helping startups succeed, we help unlock more human potential to make positive 
changes in the world.

## Open-Source

Operately is open company, with an open-source product.

We strongly believe in the power of community and the impact it can have on building 
and scaling successful startups. By building in the open, we hope to build a community 
of founders, operators, and builders who can collaborate, share insights and best 
practices, and support one another in their journey toward success.
