you need to know about the company. Our values, policies, how we work and communicate.
It is important to review everything in this handbook so you know what is expected 
of you, and what you can expect from us.

Please reach out to your manager if you have any question about the content or the
information contained in this handbook.

## Goals of the Handbook

1. **Standardize procedures and practices**: The handbook provides detailed
   guidelines and standardized processes for various tasks and operations. This
   standardization ensures consistency in how work is performed and decisions
   are made across the organization.

2. **Facilitate onboarding and training**: New employees use the handbook as a
   primary resource to understand the company's workflows, culture, and
   expectations. This speeds up the onboarding process, making it easier for new
   hires to integrate into the team and become productive.

3. **Knowledge sharing and accessibility**: The handbook is a central repository
   of knowledge, capturing and sharing information critical to the functioning
   of the company. It helps in breaking down silos and ensuring that important
   knowledge isn’t just held by a few individuals.

4. **Guide decision making**: By outlining the company's principles, strategies,
   and methodologies, the handbook aids in aligning individual decisions with
   the organization’s overall direction and goals.

5. **Inspiration to founders**: The handbook is a public document, available 
   to everyone. It serves as inspiration and reference point to startup founders 
   on how to build and organize their companies.
