# Our Values

We are a remote, async-first, distributed, open source company. Our mission,
vision, and values is what holds us together.

Values and operating principles is how we behave and organize ourselves, what
we expect from you and what you can expect from us. It is not a wishlist, or
what we strive to achive in the future. It is the essence of our character, 
both on a good day and on a bad one. It describes the behaviour of the people 
we hire.

When in doubt, always make a decision that aligns with our values and operating
priciples.

## Core values

At the core of Operately is the maker mindset, from which we derive 3 timeless values:

1. Create Value
2. Collaborate
3. Continuously Improve

### Create value

Our mission is tough, we want to empower _every_ startup to execute at the 
_highest level_. We need to demonstrate undeniable value, and we need people who
are able to create it. People who take ownership, have bias for action, benchmark
themselves against the best, and have the capacity to deliver high-quality work.
We value drivers, not passengers.

### Collaborate

To achieve results, we must work together effectively. We need to be open, share,
help each other succeed, and respect each other's time. We need to be kind, open
minded, and assume the best intention. We need to provide feedback, take each other
seriously, and examine our convictions with humility. We are ego-less when searching
for the best ideas.

    ]
  }}

### Continuously Improve

Out core belief is that we can always grow, learn, and improve. We are not born with
a fixed set of talents. As a company and as individuals, we are driven to seek out 
new opportunities, remain humble, and never settle for mediocrity. There is no room
for complaints, and work should never be boring.

We hire people based on their trajectory, not their credentials. 
We continiously rise demands on ourselves, and we expect the same from you.

## Operating Principles

If the core values are internal essence, the operating principles are the pillars 
that hold it up. They are the guiding principles that help us make decisions and 
take actions.

1. Iteration
2. Simplicity
3. Autonomy
4. Trust
5. Efficiency

### Iteration

We have a humble conviction that we can accomplish anything through iteration.
We do the smallest thing possible, ship it as quickly as possible, get feedback,
learn from it, improve or adjust course, rinse, repeat. 

Speed matters in business. Learning is best done through doing. Most decisions 
are reversible. We avoid analysis-paralysis and donâ€™t get stuck in the details. 
When faced with a big task or a problem, we solve it by "getting real": we smartly
separate what must be done well now and what can be improved later.

Iteration doesn't mean that we don't have a clear vision of the desired outcome.
When iterating, keep your eyes on the global maximum. Don't get stuck in the local
maxima.

### Simplicity

The speed of inivation is constrained by the total complexity, so every reduction in 
complexity helps. We belive that simple technology, design, and service win.

Don't confuse simple and easy. Simplicity requires active effort and a neverending fight
against entropy. Continiously opting for easy solutions, will not lead to a simple life,
product, or company.

### Autonomy

Autonomy is the freedom to act independently. It is a requirement to feel motivated at work,
along with mastery of the craft and purpose of the job. Autonomy is what allows us:

- To not micromanage every decision
- To move fast and experiment more
- To have a flexible work schedule
- To have a good work-life balance
- To work with the best people around the world
- To not be idle and wait the next check-in to take action

We have a strong bias for hiring self-managed people, who do it themselves, who don't wait,
and who don't need constant hand-holding.

Don't conflate being autonomous with being afraid of asking questions, collaborating with
others, or seeking help when needed. Autonomy means having the freedom to make decisions, but 
it also involves knowing when to seek input and work together with others to achieve the best 
outcomes.

### Trust

Trust is the foundation of any relationship, and it is the glue that holds us together. Our
default is to trust each other, and we assume that everyone is doing their best. We trust that
people are competent, that they are honest, and that they have the best intentions. We trust
that people will deliver on their promises, and we trust that they will ask for help when needed.

Trust is not blind faith. Trust is earned, and it is a two-way street. 

Trust is also fragile. It is easily broken, and it is hard to repair. We don't take trust for granted, 
and we work hard to maintain it. We are transparent, honest, and open in our communication. We 
admit when we make mistakes, and we take responsibility for our actions. We don't hide information, 
and we don't withhold feedback. We treat each other with respect, and we value each other's 
opinions.

### Efficiency

Efficiency is near and dear to an all remote, async-first, company. Part of what attracts team
members to an all remote role is the desire to create a more efficient day, starting with the
elimination of a commute, elimination of office distractions, unnecessary meetings, and the ability
to work when you are most productive.

Because time is our most valuable resource, we must be efficient in how we use it. Optimize for
speed, and don't waste time on things that don't matter. Be mindful of how you spend your time,
and be respectful of other people's time. Don't waste time on unnecessary meetings, long email
threads, or endless discussions. Make most decisions quickly with the knowledge that you can
reverse them, learn from them, and improve them later.

Efficiency is not about working faster or working harder. It is about working smarter, 
eliminating waste, and focusing on what matters most.
