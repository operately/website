# Cadence

Everything in the company happens in a certain cadence. The cadence is the 
rhythm of the company, the heartbeat of the organization. It is the regularity 
and frequency of events, meetings, and interactions that keep the company 
moving forward.

- **Daily**: Daily standups.
- **Weekly**: Weekly project check-ins.
- **Monthly**: Goal updates, and 1-1s between managers and reports.
- **Quarterly**: Quarterly planning and goal setting.
- **Yearly**: Yearly planning and performance reviews for employees.

## Daily

### Standups

Each day, the team gathers for a standup meeting. The standup is a quick
meeting where each team member shares what they did yesterday, what they plan
to do today, and any blockers they are facing. The standup is a way to keep
everyone in the loop, aligned on priorities, and to unblock any issues that
might be holding up progress.

To keep the standup efficient:

- Update your tickets and tasks before the standup.
- Keep updates brief and to the point.
- Focus on blockers and issues that need help. 
- Schedule follow-up meetings for deeper discussions.
- Don't be late.

## Weekly

### Project Check-ins

Each week, project champions submit a check-in in Operately. The check-in
includes a summary of the project status, progress made, and any blockers or
issues that need attention. 

The check-in is a way to keep the team updated and raise any issues that need
attention. The reviewer of the project is usually the manager or a senior team
member who is not directly involved in the project, but can provide guidance
and resolve blockers.

## Monthly

### Goal Updates

Each month, goal champions submit an update on the progress of their goals.
The update includes a summary of the progress made, any issues or blockers
faced, and any changes to the goal or strategy. The goal update adjusts the
values of the success metrics and the timeline of the goal if needed.

### 1-1s

Each month, managers and reports have a 1-1 meeting. The 1-1 is a time for the
manager and report to discuss any issues, blockers, or feedback. The 1-1 is a
way to build a relationship between the manager and report, and to provide
feedback and guidance on the report's work and career development.

## Quarterly

### Planning and Goal Setting

Each quarter, we review our goals and set new ones for the next quarter. The
quarterly planning is a time to reflect on the progress made, adjust the
strategy and goals, and set new goals for the next quarter. The planning
session is usually a team meeting where everyone contributes to the discussion
and sets the goals for the next quarter.

## Yearly

### Planning and Goal Setting

Each year, we review our goals and set new ones for the next year. The yearly
planning is a time to reflect on the progress made, adjust the strategy and
goals, and set new goals for the next year. The planning session is usually a
team meeting where everyone contributes to the discussion and sets the goals
for the next year.

### Performance Reviews

Each year, employees have a performance review with their manager. The
performance review is a time to reflect on the employee's work, provide
feedback on their performance, and set goals for the next year. The performance
review is a way to recognize the employee's achievements, provide feedback on
areas of improvement, and set goals for the next year.
