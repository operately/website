# Performance Reviews

Performance reviews are a way to evaluate the performance of employees. 
They are a way to provide feedback, recognize accomplishments, provide guidance
on career advancement. Likewise, the review is also a moment for employees to
self-reflect, give feedback on the management process and the company as a whole.

During your first year at Operately, you'll have three formal performance reviews.
At the 1 month, 6 month, and 12 month mark. After the first year, you'll have
regular performance reviews on a yearly basis.

## 1 Month Mark

At the 1 month mark, you'll have your first performance review with your manager.
The first performance review is a way to evaluate your fitness with the job, your
ability to work with others, and your ability to take feedback and adopt to the
culture at Operately.

On occassion, despite our best efforts to hire the right people, things don't work
out. If during that time it starts looking like your long-term employment at Operately
won't work out, your manager will let you know early and share feedback on why.

Put in your best effort, make sure to reach out for help when you need it, embrace
the feedback you receive, and you'll do great. To succesfully pass the 1 month mark,
you should demonstrate clear signs of performance and fitness for the job.

- Have a set of accomplishments to show. For example, completed tasks, resolved issues, 
  technical specification, design documents, wireframes, bug reports, project plans,
  documentation, etc. Aim to have 20 or more clear contributions to show.

- Demonstrate the ability to work with others. For example, have a good relationship
  with your team, have a good relationship with your manager, have a good relationship
  with other teams, have a good relationship with the company as a whole. Respect
  each other's time, be punctual, be respectful, be helpful, be kind, and honest.
