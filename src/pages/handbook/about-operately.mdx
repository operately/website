# About Operately

Operatelyâ€™s mission is to empower every startup to execute at the highest level. 

We recognize that while startup founders are brilliant innovators, they often 
struggle with the operational challenges of building a company. At Operately, we 
provide the systems and tools needed to streamline execution, maintain focus, and 
boost information flow. By helping startups succeed, we help unlock more human 
potential to make positive changes in the world.

Read the [Masterplan](https://operately.com/masterplan/) for further details on our
vision and how we plan to achieve it.

## Operately (the company)

Operately is a remote, async-fist, distributed, open-source company.

### Remote

We are a remote-first company, which means that all employees work from location
outside of a traditional office. Remote work is superior to both employees and the 
company. It offers flexibility, eliminates commutes, and allows the company to hire 
the best talent, regardless of their location.

We are NOT a work from anywhere company. We require employees to have a dedicated
workspace that is free from distractions and interruptions, secure and reliable
internet connection, and a quiet environment for calls and meetings.

### Async-First

Most of the work you do at Operately shouldn't require you to be in constant communication
throughout the entire day with someone, e.g. a manager or a colleague.



### Distributed

### Open-Source

Operately is an open company, with an open-source product.

We strongly believe in the power of community and the impact it can have on building 
and scaling successful startups. By building in the open, we hope to build a community 
of founders, operators, and builders who can collaborate, share insights and best 
practices, and support one another in their journey toward success.
