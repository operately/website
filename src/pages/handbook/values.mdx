# Core Values and Operating Principles

We are a remote, async-first, distributed, open-source company. Our core values 
and operating priciples is what holds us together.

It is how we behave and how we organize ourselves. What we expect from you and
what you can expect from us. It is not a wishlist, or what we strive to achive
in the future. It is the essence of our character, both on a good day and on a
bad one. It describes the behaviour of the people we hire.

When in doubt, always make a decision that aligns with our values and operating
priciples.

## Our core values

1. Create Value
2. Collaborate
3. Continiously Improve

## Operating Principles

1. Iterate
2. Make is simple
3. Be autonomous
4. Trust each other
5. Be efficient

## Let's break it down

### Create value

Our mission is tough, we want to empower _every_ startup to execute at the 
_highest level_. We need to demonstrate undeniable value. We need people who
are able to create value. To organize ourselves to be more than just the sum 
of individuals.

- Set ambitious and measurable goals
- Seek to understand our customers and community
- Measure impact, not activity
- Dogfood our product and processes. Don't give untested advice.

### Collaborate

We strongly believe in the power of community and the impact it can have on building 
and scaling successful startups. Treat our customers, each other, and contributors 
with respect and empathy.

- Be kind
- Be open & open minded
- Share
- Help others succeed
- Respect each others' time
- Take responsibility
- Say thank you
- Say sorry
- Assume the best intention
- Provide feedback
- Take each other seriously
- Don't let each other fail
- Leave your ego at home
- Avoid gossip
- Avoid pulling rank
- Avoid blaming others
- Don't harrass or discriminate

Give negative feedback in the smallest setting possible. One-on-one video calls are preferred.

## Continiously Improve

We know that our talents can grow through dedicated effort, focused training, learning 
from peers, hands-on experience, and receiving constructive feedback. As a company and as 
individuals, we are driven to seek out new opportunities, remain humble, and never settle 
for mediocrity.

We hire people based on their trajectory, not their credentials. We continiously rise demands
on ourselves, and we expect the same from you.

- Use failure as a lesson
- Avoid complaining, do it youself
- Increase your competence, its a win-win-win for you, the company, and the community
- Cross organizational boundaries
- Be a driver, not a passenger, benchmark yourself against the best

## Iterate

We iterate to do the smallest viable and valuable thing, and get feedback as soon as possible.
While you should have a clear vision of the desired outcome, don't write a large plan, only the
first step, and trust that you'll know better when it is released.

- The best way to learn is to do
- The best way to get feedback is to show and ask
- Start small, verify, adjust the course, and keep iterating
- Optimize the process for rapid experiments
- Keep in mind that most decisions are reversible
- When faced with a big challenge, break it down. If it is still too big, break it down further
- Separate what needs to be answered now, and what can be answered later

When iterating keep your eyes on the global maximum. Don't get stuck in the local maxima.

## Make it simple

Use the simplest solution for a problem. Have a strong bias for simple technology, 
design, process, or services. The speed of inivation is constrained by the total 
complexity, so every reduction in complexity helps.

Don't confuse simple and easy. Simplicity requires active effort and a neverending fight
against entropy. Continiously opting for easy solutions, will not lead to a simple life,
product, or company.

## Be autonomous

Autonomy is allowing people to be creative, take full ownership in their work, and to work
when/where they want. Be self-managed, make decisions and be accountable. 

Autonomy is what allows us:

- To have a good work-life balance
- To not micromanage every decision
- To move fast and experiment more
- To have a flexible work schedule
- To be able to hire people accross the globe
- To not be idle and wait the next check-in to take action

We have a strong bias for hiring self-managed people, who do it themselves, who don't wait,
and who don't need constant hand-holding.

Don't conflate being autonomous with being afraid of asking questions, collaborating with
others, or seeking help when needed. Autonomy means having the freedom to make decisions, but 
it also involves knowing when to seek input and work together with others to achieve the best 
outcomes.
