We are a remote, async-first, distributed, open-source company. Our core values 
and operating priciples is what holds us together.

It is how we behave and how we organize ourselves. What we expect from you and
what you can expect from us. It is not a wishlist, or what we strive to achive
in the future. It is the essence of our character, both on a good day and on a
bad one. It describes the behaviour of the people we hire.

When in doubt, always make a decision that aligns with our values and operating
priciples.

## Our core values

1. Create Value
2. Collaborate
3. Continiously Improve

## Operating Principles

1. Iterate
2. Make is simple
3. Be autonomous
4. Trust each other
5. Be efficient

## Let's break it down

### Create value

Our mission is tough, we want to empower _every_ startup to execute at the 
_highest level_. We need to demonstrate undeniable value. We need people who
are able to create value. To organize ourselves to be more than just the sum 
of individuals. To spend most of our time creating value. Toil is our enemy.

### Collaborate

We strongly believe in the power of community and the impact it can have on building 
and scaling successful startups. Treat our customers, each other, and contributors 
with respect and empathy.
