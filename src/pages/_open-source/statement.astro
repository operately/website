    <h1>Why open source?</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      Simple: <strong>Business software needs a reset</strong>. The era of
      bloated companies charging you for every person who needs to see a task is
      ending. Future products should be sustainable, open, and transparent.
    </p>

    <h3>Open code, faster progress</h3>
    <p>
      We're building Operately in the open because the best ideas can come from
      anywhere. Bug fixes, features, improvements – software thrives when smart
      people can see how it works and make it better.
    </p>

    <h3>Full transparency</h3>
    <p>
      Your business runs on this software. You should be able to see exactly
      what it does. No surprises, no dark patterns, no lock-in. Just clean,
      auditable code that does what it says.
    </p>

    <h3>Run it your way</h3>

    <p>
      Self-host it. Build on top of it. Make it yours. Your processes are too
      important to be trapped in someone else's black box.
    </p>

    <h3>An open foundation for sharing</h3>

    <p>
      The best business practices should be shared, not hidden behind paywalls.
      Templates, workflows, processes – when shared and collaborated openly,
      they create a rising tide that lifts all boats.
    </p>

      Yes, we offer a hosted version. Yes, we charge for it. But the code is
      yours, forever. That's our promise.
