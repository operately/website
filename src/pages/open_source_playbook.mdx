Operately is an open company, with an open-source product.

We strongly believe in the power of community and the impact it can have on building 
and scaling successful startups. By building in the open, we build a community of 
founders, operators, and builders who can collaborate, share insights and best 
practices, and support one another in their journey toward success.

# Making Open Source Truly Open

Software development is too often shrouded in secrecy. Fake open-source projects
are popping up everywhere, with companies claiming to be open-source while keeping
their development process and decision-making behind closed doors. Contributing to
such projects is like throwing code over a wall and hoping it sticks.

True open-source isn't just about openinig up the codebase. It's about opening up
every decision, every conversation, every plan, and every piece of information
that can help the community understand the project and contribute to it. It's about
building a community that is as much a part of the project as the core team.

Building in the open is hard. It requires discipline, transparency, and a willingness
to be vulnerable. But the rewards are immense. By building in the open, we can
leverage the collective intelligence of the community, build trust, and create a
sustainable product that can outlast any single contributor or company.

# The Operately Open Source Playbook

This playbook is a living document that outlines how we build and operate Operately
as an open-source company. It covers everything from how we make decisions to how
we communicate, collaborate, and build our product. 

What follows is a set of principles and practices that guide our work.

## Build in Public, For Real

If we’re serious about open source, we’ve got to go all-in on building in
public. This means our process isn’t just behind-the-scenes decision making 
it’s open, visible, and transparent. People can follow along, give feedback, 
and steer Operately by engaging with us in real-time.

What does this look like in practice?

- **Open Code**: Our code is open-source, and we welcome contributions from the community.
- **Open Design**: We share our design process, from wireframes to final designs.
- **Open Issues**: Our issue tracker is open, and we encourage the community to report bugs and suggest features.
- **Open Roadmaps**: Our roadmap is public, and we actively seek feedback on it.
- **Open Discussions**: We discuss our decisions, challenges, and learnings in the open.
- **Open Documentation**: Our documentation is open, and we encourage the community to help improve it.

## Communicate in Public

Communication is the lifeblood of any organization, and in an open-source organization,
it’s even more critical. We strive to communicate openly, honestly, and transparently
with the community, our contributors, and each other.

What does this look like in practice?

- **Public Meetings**: We hold public meetings where anyone can join and participate even if they're not part of the core team.
- **Public Discord Channels**: We use public Discord channels for real-time communication.
- **Live meetings are recorded**: We record all meetings and make them available to the rest of the community via the Operately Backstage YouTube channel.
- **Devlogs**: The core team records weekly devlogs to share what they've been working on and what they've learned.
- **No Direct Messages**: We avoid direct messages for work-related communication and use public channels instead.
- **Public standups**: We hold public standups, it is open to everyone, not just the core team.

## Make contributing effortless

We want to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute to Operately.
This means lowering the barrier to entry, providing clear guidelines, and
offering support and mentorship to new contributors. If you want to contribute
to Operately, our job is to make it easy for you.

What does this look like in practice?

- **Contributor Guidelines**: We have clear guidelines on how to contribute to Operately.
- **Good First Issues**: We tag issues that are good for first-time contributors and maintain a list of them.
- **Mentorship**: We offer mentorship to new contributors to help them get started.

- **Community Calls**: We hold regular community calls where contributors can ask questions, share ideas, and get to know the core team.
- **Reporting Security Issues**: We have a clear process for reporting security issues and a responsible disclosure policy.

## Make it cool to be a contributor

Contributing to Operately shouldn’t just feel like work—it should feel
exciting. People should want to be a part of what we’re building. That happens
when contributors feel seen, appreciated, and proud of the impact they’re
making.

What does this look like in practice?

- **Swag**: We send swag to our top contributors to thank them for their hard work.
- **Bug Bounties**: We offer bug bounties to reward contributors for finding and fixing bugs.
- **Contributor Events**: We host contributor events, like hackathons and meetups, to bring the community together.

- **Hacktoberfest**: We participate in Hacktoberfest and encourage our contributors to do the same.

## Track, Learn, and Improve

Building in the open is an ongoing process of iteration and improvement. We beleive
that it is impossible to get everything right the first time. We track our progress,
learn from our mistakes, and constantly seek to improve our processes and practices.

We track contributions, community engagement, and the health of open-source.

- **Openess Score**: We track our open-source efforts using a scorecard.
- **Contributions**: We track the number of contributions, contributors, and pull requests to measure community involvement.
- **GitHub Stars**: We track the number of GitHub stars, forks, and issues to measure community engagement.
