# Download and Install Operately

This guide walks you through downloading and installing Operately on your own infrastructure.

Pre-requisites:

- [Select a server](#select-a-server)
- [Configure a domain for your server](#configure-a-domain-for-your-server)
- [Install Docker and Docker Compose](#install-docker-and-docker-compose)
- [Set up email delivery](#set-up-email-delivery)

Installation steps:

- [Download the latest release of Operately](#download-the-latest-release-of-operately)
- [Configure Operately](#configure-operately)
- [Start Operately](#start-operately)

## Pre-requisites

### Select a server

Choose a machine to host Operately. For cloud hosting, we recommend 
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), or 
[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/).

Minimum requirements:
- 2GB RAM and 1 CPU (suitable for teams up to 30 people)
- 8GB RAM and 4 CPUs (recommended for larger teams)

### Configure a domain for your server

Point a domain to your server. You can use a subdomain (e.g. `operately.example.com`) or a
root domain (e.g. `example.com`). Configure the DNS records to point to your server's IP
address. Make sure it's a direct DNS pointer, not a proxy (e.g. avoid Cloudflare proxy).

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

Operately runs as a set of Docker containers orchestrated by Docker Compose.
Install Docker and Docker Compose for your operating system:

- [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Set up email delivery

Operately needs to send emails for notifications, invitations, and other communications. You can choose between two options:

#### Option 1: SendGrid (Recommended)

SendGrid provides reliable email delivery with minimal configuration. Set up a SendGrid account and create an API key
by following the instructions in the [SendGrid documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/).

#### Option 2: SMTP Server

Alternatively, you can configure Operately to use any SMTP server. This includes:

- **Gmail**: Use your Gmail account with an app-specific password
- **Outlook/Hotmail**: Use your Microsoft account with app password
- **Amazon SES**: Use your AWS SES SMTP credentials
- **Your own mail server**: Any SMTP-compatible server

**Common SMTP Configuration Examples:**

**Gmail:**
- Host: `smtp.gmail.com`
- Port: `587` (TLS) or `465` (SSL)
- Username: Your Gmail address
- Password: App-specific password (not your regular password)

**Outlook/Hotmail:**
- Host: `smtp-mail.outlook.com`
- Port: `587`
- Username: Your Outlook email address
- Password: App-specific password

**Amazon SES:**
- Host: `email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` (or your AWS region)
- Port: `587` or `465`
- Username: Your SMTP username from AWS SES
- Password: Your SMTP password from AWS SES

You'll need to gather these SMTP settings before running the installation script.

## Installation steps

### Download the latest release of Operately

Download and extract the latest Operately release:

```bash
wget -q https://github.com/operately/operately/releases/latest/download/operately-single-host.tar.gz
tar -xf operately-single-host.tar.gz
cd operately
```

### Run the installation script

Run the installation script to configure Operately:

```
./install.sh
```

The script will
- Build the Docker images
- Configure the environment
- Set up a Let's encrypt certificate
- Prompt you for the following information:
  - *Domain*: The domain you configured for your server (e.g. `operately.example.com`)
  - *Admin email*: The email address for receiving Let's Encrypt notifications
  - *Email configuration*: Choose between SendGrid or SMTP
    - **If using SendGrid**: Your SendGrid API key
    - **If using SMTP**: SMTP server details (host, port, username, password, encryption type)

### Launch Operately

Start Operately using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --wait --detach
```

Operately should now be running on your server. You can access it by navigating to your
configured domain (e.g. `https://operately.example.com`).
