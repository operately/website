Operately v1.3 is here! This release brings Kanban views for project tasks and space tasks with slide-in task details, a new Tasks tab on profiles, and space-level tool controls.

## Project Tasks Kanban: Plan and execute on a Kanban board

Projects now have a Kanban view for tasks that shows task statuses at a glance, with custom statuses configurable per project.

**Slide-in task details**: Click any task card to open a slide-in view with the task description, status, due date, comments, and activity timeline. You can review or update task details without leaving the page.

## Space Tasks Kanban: Manage team work at the space level

Spaces can now host tasks that are not tied to a specific project. This is perfect for ongoing team work, operational checklists, and shared ownership.

You get the same Kanban experience as projects, including drag-and-drop columns, custom statuses, and the slide-in task view, so space-level work stays just as organized.

## Profile Tasks Tab: See your current work in one place

Profile pages now include a **Tasks** tab that shows ongoing tasks assigned to each person. It is a quick way to review what's in progress, what is coming up, and where attention is needed.

## Space Tools: Enable only tools that your team needs

Space admins can now enable or disable tools for each space, including the Resource Hub, Discussions, and Tasks. Keep each space focused on the workflows that matter, and hide sections your team does not use.
