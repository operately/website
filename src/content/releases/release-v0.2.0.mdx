Operately's latest release is packed with improvements designed to make your
company’s operations smoother and more efficient. Here’s what’s new!

## Project Retrospectives that drive results

We've upgraded our project retrospectives. Now you can squeeze more value from
every project you complete. Our new retrospectives let you easily review past
projects, discuss improvements openly, and learn from your team's insights.

We built this feature because we know how hard it is to pause and reflect when 
you're moving fast. But those moments of reflection are gold. They help you avoid
repeating mistakes and double down on what's working.

Try it out. Open a recent project and start a retrospective. You might be 
surprised by the insights you uncover.

## Onboard and Offboard people faster

We've streamlined team management for company admins. The new admin page puts
more control at your fingertips.

Company admins now have more control over managing and updating profiles.
Whether it's assigning manager-reporter relationships or changing someone's
title, it's all doable from the new admin page. Need to remove someone who has
left the company? Their account will now be automatically suspended,
streamlining off-boarding without the hassle.

As an admin click on the company dropdown -> Company Admin -> Manage Team Members.

## Manage who does what on your projects

We've upgraded how Operately handles project team changes. Now it's easier to
match people's roles to their real responsibilities.

Say your lead developer Sarah steps up to manage a critical feature launch. In
seconds, you can promote her from contributor to project champion. She gets the
right access, and you keep moving. Or three software engineers join the project, 
each responsible for a different part of the system. Now, you add all three at once, 
assigning them specific responsibilities and keeping everyone in the loop.

Why does this matter? Because in the real world, roles change. People step up.
New folks join. You shouldn't need an IT degree to keep your project moving when 
this happens. We built this because we've felt this pain ourselves. Unclear 
responsibilities kill momentum. They breed confusion.

## Security and Compliance with One-Click Access Oversight

We just fixed a headache you might not even know you had. It's about who has
access to your projects. As your company grows, keeping track of who can see 
what becomes a mess. It's a security risk waiting to happen. And when the auditors
come knocking? Good luck. So we made it simple. Dead simple.

We built this because we've been there. Digging through settings,
cross-checking spreadsheets, wondering if we missed someone. It's a waste of
time and it's nerve-wracking. Not anymore.

Go to a project -> Manage Team & Access -> on the bottom click show all.

## Your Inbox, Your Rules: New Subscription Controls

You can also control who will receive notifications in any type of a message
that you send across spaces, projects, and goals.. Stay updated on the
discussions that matter to you and tune out the ones that don’t. Whether it's
project updates, comments, or notifications, you can easily manage what shows
up in your inbox with just a click.
