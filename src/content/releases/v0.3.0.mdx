Operately 0.3 is here, packed with improvements that make your Operately
experience even better. In this release, we're focusing on reducing noise,
improving focus, making it easier to manage confidential work, and giving
you a comprehensive oversight of who has access to your spaces.

## Notification Improvements: Less Noise, More Focus

We’ve all been there. You open the app, and there’s a flood of notifications.
Some are important, but some are no longer relevant. You spend time sifting
through them, trying to find the ones that matter. To improve the experience,
Operately now auto-detects which page you’re on and clears notifications tied
to that content. No more notification overload—just a cleaner, more focused
experience.

## Private Spaces for Confidential Work

Operately now supports private spaces, for when you need to keep
your work confidential. Projects, discussions, and goals created
in this space are only visible to the people you invite. 

While Operately is designed to promote transparency and collaboration,
we understand that some information needs to be kept private, e.g. 
sensitive customer data, financial information, or confidential information
disclosed with HR.

To create a private space, click on the "Create Space" button. The default
access level is "Company-wide", but you can change it to "Invite-only"
by clicking edit and selecting "No access" for company members.

## Space Managers

Spaces have a new role: Space Managers. Space Managers have full access
to a space, including the ability to invite people, create projects, and
manage access, and complete access to all projects within the space.

They play a key role in keeping things organized, ensuring nothing falls
through the cracks, and wrapping up loose ends. Whether it's managing access or
maintaining project alignment, Space Managers help keep everything running
smoothly, making sure the space remains focused and efficient.

## One-click oversight of who has access to a space

We just fixed a headache you might not even know you had: having
a complete, unambiguous list of people who have access to your space.

As a company grows, keeping track of who can access what becomes challenging.
Now, you can see all people who are not direct members of the space but
can implicitly view it based on their company membership.

We've made it simple:

1. Go to a space -> Manage Access
2. At the bottom, click "show all"

You will see all people who are not directly assigned as members to the
space but can implicitly view it based on their company membership.
