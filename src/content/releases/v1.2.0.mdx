Operately v1.2 is here! This release brings a redesigned Review Page with comprehensive visibility into all your work, Global Search for finding anything instantly, streamlined team onboarding with invite links, and subscription controls for projects, milestones, and tasks.

We've also added comment management with deletion and link sharing, space deletion with cascade cleanup, expanded emoji reactions with search, profile picture updates, and drag-and-drop milestone reordering.

## Redesigned Review Page: See all work that needs your attention

The Review Page has been completely redesigned to give you a comprehensive view of everything that needs your attention. Previously, the page only showed check-ins and reviews. Now it includes **due milestones and tasks** alongside check-ins and reviews.

**Better organization through resource grouping**: Review items are now grouped by their parent resource—Goals and Projects. This makes it easy to see all the work related to a specific goal or project in one place.

Whether you're an owner responsible for delivering work or a reviewer providing feedback, the new Review Page shows exactly what needs your attention and when.

## Faster Onboarding: Get your team up and running in minutes

Starting a new organization in Operately is now easier than ever. The **new onboarding wizard** guides you through the essential setup steps, helping you create spaces and invite your team without any confusion.

When you create a new organization, the wizard walks you through:
- Setting up your first spaces to organize work by team or department
- Inviting team members to get everyone on board quickly

## Team Invite Links: Invite your whole team with a single link

Inviting team members one by one is tedious and time-consuming. With **Team Invite Links**, you can now generate a shareable link that lets anyone join your organization instantly.

This is perfect for:
- Onboarding entire departments or teams at once
- Quickly expanding your organization as you grow

You maintain full control over invite links—enable or disable them as needed, and regenerate new links which automatically invalidates the previous one for enhanced security.

## Global Search: Find anything, instantly

Finding specific goals, projects, tasks, or people across your organization is now effortless. The new **Global Search** in the navbar lets you search across all resources and get instant results.

Start typing in the search bar, and you'll immediately see matching:
- **Goals** with their champions and spaces
- **Projects** with their owners and teams
- **Tasks** with their assignees and parent projects
- **People** with their roles and titles

Search results are organized by resource type, making it easy to scan and find exactly what you're looking for. Click any result to jump directly to that resource's page.

Global Search is always accessible from the navbar.

## Additional Features

This release also includes several enhancements based on user feedback:

**Subscriptions for Projects, Milestones, and Tasks**: Subscribe to specific projects, milestones, and tasks to receive notifications whenever they're updated. Follow work outside your direct responsibilities without being overwhelmed.

**Comment Management**: Delete comments and copy direct links to any comment for easy reference and sharing.

**Space Deletion**: Delete spaces that are no longer needed with cascade cleanup that removes all associated projects, goals, and content.

**Expanded Emoji Reactions**: The emoji reactions palette has been expanded with search functionality, making it easy to find the perfect emoji from a much larger collection.

**Profile Picture Updates**: Update your profile picture directly from your profile settings to personalize your account.

**Milestone Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Reorder milestones using drag-and-drop in the Overview tab on the Project page to quickly reorganize your project timeline.
