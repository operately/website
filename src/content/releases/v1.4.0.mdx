Operately v1.4 is here! This release introduces guest collaborators, complete admin
email settings, improved goal access management, and a bundled update command
that makes upgrading self-hosted installs easy and simple.

## Guest collaborators: Invite outside partners safely

You can now add guests and outside collaborators to your company without giving
them default access to all non-secret spaces, goals, and projects. Guests only
see the spaces, goals, and projects that you explicitly add them to, so external
partners can access what they need without getting broader visibility.

To make it easy to manage, the Members page now has a dedicated **Outside collaborators** section
and the Add People flow supports guest invites end-to-end.

## Admin email settings: Configure sender identity and email delivery

Admins now have a complete email settings suite in the admin UI. You can
configure SendGrid by adding your API key or set up SMTP delivery, and send a
test email to confirm everything works as expected. All keys are stored
securely in the database, encrypted at rest.

## Goal access management: A dedicated access control page

Goals now have a dedicated access management page. You can grant or remove
access for anyone in the company, including outside collaborators, and see a
full list of everyone who has access to the goal along with their access
levels.

## Additional Features

This release also includes several enhancements based on user feedback:

**Project resume improvements**: A new resume message can be added when a project is resumed.
The next check-in date is updated automatically.

**Profile description**: An "About me" section has been added to profile pages.

**Invite link visibility**: Admins can now view an invite link after it is issued.

**Update script**: Operately now ships with a useful commands script. It includes the **update** command, which makes upgrading to new versions simple and reliable for self-hosted deployments. For detailed instructions on updating your self-hosted installation, see the [self-hosted update documentation](/help/self-hosted-update).
