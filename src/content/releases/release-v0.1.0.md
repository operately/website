We're stoked to unveil the first alpha release of Operately – the open-source
startup operating system.

This initial release zeroes in on the core pillars of startup execution:

- **Goals**: Ditch the fuzzy OKRs. Operately helps you forge a crystal-clear
  direction with a hierarchy of goals and projects.
- **Projects**: Operately gives you structured, accountable projects that drive
  progress. No more guessing what's on track – you'll see it instantly.
- **Accountability & Communication**: "Who's doing what?" and "What's the
  status?" become questions of the past. Establish clear roles and set up regular
  check-ins to keep everyone aligned and information flowing.

There are definitely some rough edges, but we're releasing early because we
believe in building in public and iterating based on real user feedback.

### Why Operately?

Strong execution is a competitive advantage. But current collaboration tools
fall short in helping you attain it.

By connecting your plans directly to your day-to-day execution, Operately
creates a single source of truth for the entire company. It's like having a COO
co-founder who never sleeps, always knows what's going on, and keeps everyone
focused on what matters.

### Self-host in 5 minutes

Take Operately for a spin: you can install it on a small (1 CPU, 2GB) machine
in 5 minutes. [Follow the self-hosted installation guide][install].

If you’d rather use Operately as a SaaS,  [sign up for the cloud waiting list][waitlist].

### Get involved

Operately is open source and available under the Apache 2.0 license. We invite
you to help shape the future as an early member of the community:

- Join the conversation in [Discord][discord]
- Contribute bug reports, feature requests, and code on [GitHub][github]

We hope you enjoy using Operately as much as we enjoy building it. Here's to
many more releases to come.
