Operately 0.2 is packed with improvements that make it easier to communicate with
your team, manage access, and stay compliant. Let's dive in and see what's new.

## Project retrospectives are now communication hubs

Project retrospectives are a powerful method for learning and improving. They
help you reflect on what went well, what didn't, and what you can do better next
time. But they're often overlooked or done half-heartedly, especially when
you're moving fast. That's why we've built them into Operately.

In this release, retrospectives are now communication hubs. You can react to
them, comment on them, and edit them if you're the author. This makes it easy
to keep the conversation going openly and learn from your team's insights.

## Onboard and offboard people faster

The new Company Administration page puts more control at your fingertips.

Company admins can now:
- Assign manager-reporter relationships
- Update profiles, including titles and roles
- Add multiple people to the organization at once
- Suspend accounts for offboarding in one click

To access this page as a company admin, click on the company dropdown menu ->
Company Admin -> Manage Team Members.

## Manage who does what on your projects

We've upgraded how Operately handles project team changes. Now it's easier to
match people's roles to their real responsibilities.

**Promoting people to champions and reviewers is now a breeze**.
Say your lead developer Sarah steps up to manage a critical feature launch. In
seconds, you can promote her from contributor to project champion in seconds. She gets the right access, and you keep moving.

**You can add multiple people to a project at once, each with their own role**.
For instance, if three software engineers join a project, each responsible for
a different part of the system, you can add all three at once, assigning them
specific responsibilities and keeping everyone in the loop.

## Security and compliance: One-click access oversight

We just fixed a headache you might not even know you had: having
a complete, unambiguous list of people who have access to your project.

As a company grows, keeping track of who can access what becomes challenging.
It's a security risk waiting to happen. And when the auditors come knocking?
Good luck explaining, without hard evidence, that because Lana has X level of
access to a space, she also has Y level access to a belonging project.

We've made it simple:

1. Go to a project -> Manage Team & Access (see screenshot above)
2. At the bottom, click "show all"

You will see all people who are not directly assigned as contributors to the
project but can implicitly view it based on their company or space membership.

## Your inbox, your rules: New subscription controls

You can now control who will receive notifications for any type of message
you send across spaces, projects, and goals. Stay updated on the
discussions that matter to you and tune out the ones that don't. Whether it's
project updates, comments, or notifications, you can easily manage what shows
up in your inbox with just a click.
