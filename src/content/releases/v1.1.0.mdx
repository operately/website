Operately v1.1 is here! This release brings redesigned Project Pages, comprehensive
Task Management, and Alfred, your company's AI executive coach. We've also added
SMTP email delivery for self-hosted installations and added sorting capabilities
to docs & files.

## Redesigned Project Pages

Following the successful redesign of Goal Pages in v1.0, we've now given
projects the same treatment. The new project pages bring everything you need into
a single, organized view with improved navigation and better information hierarchy.

The redesigned project page brings together all project details - description,
milestones, tasks, contributors, discussions, and activity — into a single,
unified interface. You can easily view project status, monitor progress against
milestones, and access all related conversations without switching between
different screens.

The new layout makes it easier to understand project scope, identify what
needs attention, and see who's responsible for each aspect of the work.

## Break Projects into Actionable Steps with Tasks

All projects now include a comprehensive task management system through the new
**Tasks tab**. Break down your projects into specific, actionable tasks and track
their completion with dedicated task workflows.

- Create and organize tasks within projects
- Assign tasks to team members with clear ownership
- Set due dates and priorities for better planning
- Track task status from creation to completion
- Link tasks to project milestones and deliverables

This addition bridges the gap between high-level project planning and day-to-day
execution. While projects define what you're building and why, tasks define the
specific steps needed to get there. Team members can now see exactly what they
need to work on and when, making project execution more predictable and
organized.

## Meet Alfred: Your AI Executive Coach (Beta)

In this release, we are introducing **Alfred**, your company's AI executive coach,
now available in beta. Alfred reviews your goals and projects, spots gaps, and
provides clear, actionable feedback that helps instill the operational discipline
many startups lack.

Alfred analyzes your work structure and provides insights on:

- Goal alignment and clarity across teams
- Project scope and resource allocation
- Potential risks and dependencies
- Progress patterns and bottlenecks
- Strategic gaps in your work map

This AI coach helps leadership teams make better decisions by surfacing insights
that might otherwise go unnoticed.

Since Alfred is still in beta, we're actively gathering feedback to refine its
capabilities and ensure it delivers meaningful value to teams of every size.
To join the beta, request access via our contact page:

## Additional Improvements

This release also includes several enhancements based on user feedback:

**SMTP Email Delivery (Self‑hosted)**: Self-hosted installations can now use SMTP
for email delivery. Use SMTP with Amazon SES, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365,
or your own SMTP server. See [SMTP configuration][smtp-conf] for more information.

**File Sorting**: You can now sort items in docs & files by name, creation date,
*or modification date. This makes it easier to manage a growing document library
*and quickly find the files you need.
