Operately v1.0 is here! This release brings the new Work Map for visualizing
goals and projects, dedicated Project Discussions, and streamlined workflows.
Quick Add makes it simple to plan goals and projects for a quarter or year,
helping teams stay aligned and work efficiently.

## We're confident to call it v1.0

After several months of rapid iteration and feedback from our early adopters,
Operately has matured beyond its initial vision. The jump from v0.4 to v1.0.0
marks our transition from experimental releases to a stable, feature-rich
platform ready for wider adoption. This milestone reflects our commitment to
reliability, usability, and delivering core features that teams need to manage
work at scale.

## Work Map: Visualize all work across your organization

The new **Work Map** provides a consolidated view of all ongoing work in your
company or within specific spaces. This powerful visualization tool displays all
goals and projects in a structured, tabular format, giving you complete
visibility into what's happening across your organization.

**Company Work Map** shows all goals and projects across your entire
\*organization,
helping leadership and team members understand how work is distributed and track
overall progress.

**Space Work Map** focuses on goals and projects within specific teams, helping
space members stay aligned on current priorities and ownership.

Key features include filtering tabs to view different types of work, progress
indicators, status badges, owner information, and the ability to navigate
between spaces. Work Maps automatically update as work progresses, giving you
real-time visibility into your organization's efforts.

## Project Discussions: Collaborate where the work happens

Every project now has dedicated **Project Discussions**. Have focused
conversations about project scope, decisions, blockers, and updates right where
the work is happening.

Project Discussions keep context close to the work, making it easier for team
members to stay informed and contribute meaningfully to project success.

## Quick Add: Map out your quarter in minutes

Planning your quarter or year just got simpler. **Quick Add** is built right into
the Work Map, letting you quickly create goals and projects as you're mapping
out your plans. No need to navigate between different screens or interrupt your
planning flow.

Whether you're setting up quarterly goals or sketching out a year-long
roadmap, Quick Add keeps you in the zone. Create goals and projects on the spot,
then organize them exactly where they belong in your work structure.

## Redesigned Goal Page

The **new Goal Page** brings everything you need into a single, organized view.
See your goal description, targets with real-time values, and all connected
subgoals and projects in one place. The redesigned layout makes it easy to
track what's working, what needs attention, and who's responsible for each
piece of work.

Check-ins, discussions, and activity feed directly into the goal page, so you
always have the full context of progress and decisions.

## New About Page

The **new About Page** gives you a complete view of each team member's work and
contributions. See what someone is working on, what they're reviewing, what
they've completed, and their recent activity all in one place. The page shows
assigned work, progress indicators, due dates, and next steps for each person.

Perfect for understanding workloads, checking on project ownership, and getting
context on who's responsible for what.

## Streamlined Goal & Project Workflows

We've refined the core workflows that teams use every day:

**Streamlined Goal/Project Statuses** - Simplified status options that focus
on what matters most: whether work is on track, at risk, or needs attention.

**Simplified Goal Creation** - A more intuitive goal creation process that
guides you through setting clear objectives and success metrics.

**Improved Project & Goal Check-Ins** - Enhanced check-in flows that make
it easier to share progress, highlight wins, and surface blockers.
