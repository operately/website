Operately v1.0 is here! This milestone release brings powerful new features
that help you visualize your organization's work, collaborate more effectively,
and streamline your daily workflows. We're excited to share these improvements
that make Operately even more intuitive and powerful.

## Work Map: Visualize all work across your organization

The new **Work Map** provides a consolidated view of all ongoing work in your
company or within specific spaces. This powerful visualization tool displays
all goals and projects in a structured, tabular format, giving you complete
visibility into what's happening across your organization.

**Company Work Map** shows all goals and projects across your entire organization,
helping leadership and team members understand how work is distributed and track
overall progress.

**Space Work Map** focuses on goals and projects within specific teams, helping
space members stay aligned on current priorities and ownership.

Key features include filtering tabs to view different types of work, progress
indicators, status badges, owner information, and the ability to navigate
between spaces. Work Maps automatically update as work progresses, giving you
real-time visibility into your organization's efforts.

## Project Discussions: Collaborate where the work happens

Every project now has dedicated **Project Discussions**. Have focused conversations
about project scope, decisions, blockers, and updates right where the work is
happening. No more scattered conversations across email, Slack, and meetings.

Project Discussions keep context close to the work, making it easier for team
members to stay informed and contribute meaningfully to project success.

## Quick Add: Create content faster than ever

The new **Quick Add** feature lets you create goals, projects, discussions, and
documents from anywhere in Operately. One click opens a streamlined creation
flow that gets you back to work faster.

Whether you need to capture a quick idea, start a new project, or create a
discussion, Quick Add removes friction from content creation.

## Redesigned Goal Page

We've completely reimagined the **Goal Page** to give you better visibility into
goal progress and related work. The new design clearly shows goal metrics,
connected projects, recent updates, and team discussions all in one place.

Track progress more effectively and understand exactly what's driving your
goal forward.

## New About Page

The **new About Page** helps team members understand your company culture,
values, and important information. Share your mission, introduce leadership,
highlight achievements, and provide context that helps everyone understand
what you're building together.

## Streamlined Goal & Project Workflows

We've refined the core workflows that teams use every day:

**Streamlined Goal/Project Statuses** - Simplified status options that focus
on what matters most: whether work is on track, at risk, or needs attention.

**Simplified Goal Creation** - A more intuitive goal creation process that
guides you through setting clear objectives and success metrics.

**Improved Project & Goal Check-Ins** - Enhanced check-in flows that make
it easier to share progress, highlight wins, and surface blockers.
