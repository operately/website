Operately v1.0 is here! This release brings the new Work Map for visualizing
goals and projects, dedicated Project Discussions, and streamlined workflows.
Quick Add makes it simple to plan goals and projects for a quarter or year,
helping teams stay aligned and work efficiently.

## We're confident to call it v1.0

After several months of rapid iteration and feedback from our early adopters,
Operately has matured beyond its initial vision. The jump from v0.4 to v1.0.0
marks our transition from experimental releases to a stable, feature-rich
platform ready for wider adoption. This milestone reflects our commitment to
reliability, usability, and delivering core features that teams need to manage
work at scale.

## Work Map: Visualize all work across your organization

The new **Work Map** gives you a clear, hierarchical view of all ongoing work in
your company or within specific spaces. Goals and projects are organized in a
parent-child structure, so you can see how high-level objectives break down into
smaller goals and projects. This hierarchy helps everyone understand how
individual pieces of work contribute to broader company priorities.

For example, a top-level company goal might have several subgoals, each with
their own projects. The Work Map displays these relationships visually, making
it easy to trace progress from the smallest project up to the company’s main
objectives.

**Company Work Map** shows all goals and projects across your entire
*organization, helping leadership and team members see how work is distributed
*and track overall progress.

**Space Work Map** focuses on goals and projects within specific teams, so space
members can stay aligned on current priorities and ownership.

Key features include filtering tabs to view different types of work, progress
indicators, status badges, owner information, and the ability to navigate
between spaces. Work Maps automatically update as work progresses, giving you
real-time visibility into your organization's efforts.

## Project Discussions: Collaborate where the work happens

Every project now has dedicated **Project Discussions**. Have focused
conversations about project scope, decisions, blockers, and updates right where
the work is happening.

Project Discussions keep context close to the work, making it easier for team
members to stay informed and contribute meaningfully to project success.

## Quick Add: Map out your quarter in minutes

Planning your quarter or year just got simpler. **Quick Add** is built right into
the Work Map, letting you quickly create goals and projects as you're mapping
out your plans. No need to navigate between different screens or interrupt your
planning flow.

Whether you're setting up quarterly goals or sketching out a year-long
roadmap, Quick Add keeps you in the zone. Create goals and projects on the spot,
then organize them exactly where they belong in your work structure.

## Redesigned Goal Page

The **new Goal Page** brings everything you need into a single, organized view.
See your goal description, targets with real-time values, and all connected
subgoals and projects in one place. The redesigned layout makes it easy to
track what's working, what needs attention, and who's responsible for each
piece of work.

Check-ins, discussions, and activity feed directly into the goal page, so you
always have the full context of progress and decisions.

## New Profile Pages

The **new Profile Pages** provide a complete view of each team member’s work and contributions. See what someone is working on, what they’re reviewing, what they’ve completed, and their recent activity—all in one place. The page highlights assigned work, progress indicators, due dates, and next steps for each person.

Your own profile is now available from **"My work"** in the top navigation and looks just like everyone else’s. This unified experience makes it easier to understand your responsibilities, track your progress, and compare workloads across the team. It also fosters transparency and alignment, since everyone sees the same information in the same way.

Perfect for understanding workloads, checking on project ownership, and getting context on who’s responsible for what.

## Streamlined Goal & Project Workflows

We've refined the core workflows that teams use every day by addressing pain
points we saw in earlier versions:

**Streamlined Goal/Project Statuses**

_Before_: Projects and goals each had their own status sets, optimized for their
specific workflows. But when viewing everything together, these subtle
differences created noise and made it harder to get a clear picture.

_Now_: We've unified statuses for both goals and projects. This consistent
approach makes it easy to scan all work at a glance, spot what needs attention,
and understand progress across your organization.

**Simplified Goal Creation**

_Before_: Creating goals felt overwhelming, with too many required fields on a
single page—such as defining all targets, choosing a champion and reviewer,
setting visibility, and writing a description—which led to inconsistent
objectives.

_Now_: The new process guides you step-by-step, focusing only on the essentials:
the name of the goal and which team is responsible. You can fill in additional
details later on the goal page, making it easier to get started and refine your
objectives as you go.

**Simplified Goal Check-Ins**

_Before_: Check-ins were a bit of a guessing game. You could say how a goal was
going, but it rarely told the whole story. Reviewers had to chase down details
or ask follow-up questions just to understand what was really happening.

_Now_: Check-ins are straightforward and focused. You answer three things:
What’s the status? Is the due date still accurate? How’s progress? The new
check-in page puts everything front and center—no hunting for info, no
back-and-forth. Everyone gets a clear, honest update in seconds.
