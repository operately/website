Operately v0.4 is here, packed with improvements that make your Operately
experience even better. In this release, we're introducing document management, 
improving the homepage and space dashboards, and introducing new roles for 
account administration.

## Docs & Files: A central hub for all your work documents

Every space now has a dedicated Docs & Files section. **Create, upload, and 
organize documents** right where your team is working. No more searching through 
email threads or Slack channels to find that one document you need. Documents 
live where the work happens.

## Redesigned homepage

We've rebuilt the homepage for clarity. You'll see all your spaces laid out
with the people who are part of them.

On the bottom of the page, you'll see **a feed of all the activity** happening in
your company. All your team's updates, project progress, and goal completions
stream into this feed. No digging required.

## New space dashboard

We’ve redesigned the space dashboard to give you a better overview of what’s
happening in your space. The new dashboard provides **a snapshot of all the
projects, goals, discussions, and documents in the space**, so you can quickly 
see what’s going on and where you need to focus your attention.
All your team's updates, project progress, and goal completions that belong to the space stream into **the space activity feed**.

## Unified Goals & Projects

Goals & Projects should be two sides of the same coin. Goals are the outcomes
you want to achieve, and Projects are the work you need to do to get there. In
Operately v0.4, we've **unified Goals & Projects into a single view**, so you can
see how they relate to each other and track progress more easily.

## Company admins and owners

Administering your Operately account is now easier than ever. We have split the
role of Company Admin into two separate roles: Admins and Owner.

**The Admin role** is perfect for users who need to manage the day-to-day operations
of your Operately account. They can invite new users, adjust company settings,
adjust profiles of employees, and offboard users who are no longer with the company.
The role is perfect for HR, IT, Security, Compliance, and other roles that need
to manage the account.

**The Owner role** is for the person who has ultimate control over the account. They
can do everything an admin can do, plus they can delete the account and manage admins
and owners. Owners have full and direct access to all data in the account, including 
private spaces, projects, and goals.

## Draft messages

Often you need multiple passes to get a message just right, or you need to
collaborate with your team before sending it. In Operately v0.4, you can now
**save messages as drafts, review them with your team before sending**, or come
back to them later and finish them.
