Operately v0.4 is here, packed with improvements that make your Operately
experience even better. In this release, we're focusing on making it easier to
organize and share your work documents, improving the homepage and space
dashboard, unifying Goals & Projects, and introducing new roles for company
admins and owners.

## Docs & Files: A central hub for all your work documents

We've introduced a new feature called Docs & Files, which acts as a central hub
for all your work documents. Every space now has a Docs & Files section where
you can upload, organize, and share documents with your team.

No longer will you have to dig through email threads or Slack channels to find
that one document you need. With Docs & Files, everything is organized in one
place, making it easy to find what you need when you need it.

## Supercharged homepage

We've supercharged your homepage with a new design that makes it easier to
navigate and find what you need. The new homepage gives you a quick overview
of all your spaces including the people who have access to them.

On the bottom of the page, you'll find a feed of all the latest updates from
your spaces, so you can stay up-to-date with what's happening in your company.

## Redesigned space dashboard

We've redesigned the space dashboard to give you a better overview of what's
happening in your space. The new dashboard provides a snapshot of all the
projects, goals, and discussions in the space, so you can quickly see what's
going on and where you need to focus your attention.

## A unified view of Goals & Projects

Goals & Projects should be two sides of the same coin. Goals are the outcomes
you want to achieve, and Projects are the work you need to do to get there. In
Operately v0.4, we've unified Goals & Projects into a single view, so you can
see how they relate to each other and track progress more easily.

## Company admins and owners

Administering your Operately account is now easier than ever. We have split the
role of Company Admin into two separate roles: Admins and Owner.

The admin role is perfect for users who need to manage the day-to-day operations
of your Operately account. They can invite new users, adjust company settings,
adjust profiles of employees, and offboard users who are no longer with the company.
The role is perfect for HR, IT, Security, Compliance, and other roles that need
to manage the account.

The owner role is for the person who has ultimate control over the account. They
can do everything an admin can do, plus they can delete the account, manage admins
and owners, and manage billing. Owners have full and direct access to all data in
the account, including private spaces, projects, and goals.

## Draft messages

Sometimes you need to write a message, but you're not quite ready to send it.
Operately v0.4, you can now save messages as drafts, so you can come back to them
later and finish them off. Draft messages are saved in your drafts folder, so
you can easily find them when you're ready to send them.
