Goal discussions work the same way as [space discussions](/help/start-discussion) but are scoped to the specific goal. Use them to share updates, ask questions, or get feedback from your team.

## Starting a discussion

<Steps>
1. Open the goal page and go to the **Discussions** tab
2. Click **Start discussion**
3. Write your message using the rich text editor
4. Choose who to notify about the discussion
5. Click **Post** to publish
</Steps>

## When to use goal discussions

**Progress updates** — Share non-check-in updates or quick wins.

**Questions** — Ask for clarification, input, or decisions.

**Feedback requests** — Get team input on approaches or challenges.

**Collaboration** — Coordinate with team members working on the goal.

## Discussion features

Goal discussions include all the same features as space discussions:

- Rich text formatting and attachments
- Notifications and mentions
- Comment threads
- Activity tracking

For detailed information about discussions, see the [Discussions section](/help/start-discussion).
