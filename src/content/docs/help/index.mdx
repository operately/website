### Why use Operately?

Most companies end up with their work spread across too many tools - projects in one app, goals in another, KPIs in spreadsheets, and processes scattered everywhere.

Operately brings all of this into one place with proven workflows built in - from running projects and tracking goals to measuring progress. It connects company goals to day-to-day work, so everyone knows exactly what to do and how it helps the company move forward.

No more chasing people for updates or spending hours keeping everything organized. Focus on delivering value and growing your business instead.

### Who is Operately for?

Operately works for organizations of all types who want to run more effectively. It's especially valuable for:

- **Startups with 10+ people** who need to organize their work and align their teams
- **Organizations with diverse functional areas** that need a common system for marketing, sales, product, HR, and other teams
- **Teams using disconnected tools** who want to simplify and have one centralized place for projects, goals, documents, and discussions

Operately shines when staying coordinated requires more than just a few meetings and shared documents. It provides the structure to keep everyone moving in the same direction without the overhead.
