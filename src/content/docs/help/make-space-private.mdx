To make your space private and accessible only to specific people:

<Steps>
1. Go to your space
2. Click the **Manage access** button next to the member avatars
3. Find the **General Access** section
4. Click **Edit** next to "Company-wide Access"
5. Select **No Access** to remove company-wide access
</Steps>

After this, only explicitly added members will be able to access the space. You can then:
- Add specific people as members with the desired access level
- Remove members who should no longer have access

<Aside type="note">
Only space managers with Full Access can change these settings.
