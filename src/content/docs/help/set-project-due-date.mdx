## When to change due dates

Consider updating a project's due date when:

- Project requirements have expanded or been reduced

- Third-party deliverables or approvals are delayed
- Business needs have shifted the project's urgency

Keeping project due dates realistic and up-to-date ensures better planning and helps teams deliver quality work on time.
