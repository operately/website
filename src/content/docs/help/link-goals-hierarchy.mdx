Goal hierarchies help teams understand how their work contributes to larger objectives and ensure alignment across your organization.

## Setting a parent goal

<Steps>
1. Open the goal page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, find the **Parent Goal** section
3. Click **Set parent goal** to open the goal selector
4. Search for and select the appropriate parent goal
</Steps>

You can change parent goals at any time by clicking **Set parent goal** again.

## Use the Cascade approach

Based on our [Blueprint framework](/blueprint), work flows from company-wide goals down to specific projects:

**Company goals** (quarterly to annual) → **Group goals** (monthly to quarterly) → **Projects** (days to weeks)

Each level supports the one above it, creating a clear cascade of accountability and progress tracking.

Tips:
- Break down large goals into smaller, manageable pieces that different people can own.
- Prefer having more short-term, dynamic goals that can be effectively tracked and celebrated.
-  Keep hierarchies simple: 2-3 levels is usually sufficient.
