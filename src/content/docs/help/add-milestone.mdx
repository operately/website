Milestones help you break down your project into manageable phases and track progress toward completion. They represent key deliverables, deadlines, or checkpoints in your project timeline.

You can add milestones at any time during your project. Start with the most important ones and add more as your project evolves.

## Adding a milestone

### From project Overview tab

<Steps>
1. In the **Milestones** section, click **Add milestone**
2. Enter a name for your milestone
3. Optionally, set a target date 
4. Click **Add milestone** to create the milestone
</Steps>

### From Tasks tab

<Steps>
1. Click **New milestone** at the top of the Tasks tab
2. Enter a name for your milestone
3. Optionally, set a due date 
4. Click **Create milestone** to create the milestone
</Steps>

## Managing milestones

Once created, open your milestone. On the milestone page you can:

- **Add tasks** to break down the work needed to complete the milestone
- **Add a description** to provide additional context and details
- **Start a discussion** via comments to collaborate with your team
- **Adjust due date** if timelines change
- **Mark as complete** when the milestone is achieved

This approach lets you start with high-level planning and add detail as needed. You can always refine your milestones as the project progresses.

## What makes a good milestone

Effective milestones represent a specific, tangible outcome or achievement.

We recommend keeping the scope of a milestone limited to up to a week or two of work. This is to ensure milestones are used as meaningful progress markers rather than vague, long-term goals.
