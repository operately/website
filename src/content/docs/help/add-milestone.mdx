Milestones help you break down your project into manageable phases and track progress toward completion. They represent key deliverables, deadlines, or checkpoints in your project timeline.

**Note:** You can add milestones at any time during your project. Start with the most important ones and add more as your project evolves.

## Adding a milestone

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the **Milestones** section, click **Add milestone**
3. Enter a name for your milestone
4. Set a target date (optional)
6. Click **Add milestone** to create the milestone
</Steps>

## Managing milestones

Once created, you can:

- **Add tasks** to break down the work needed to complete each milestone
- **Add a description** to provide additional context and details for each milestone
- **Adjust dates** if timelines change
- **Mark as complete** when the milestone is achieved

This approach lets you start with high-level planning and add detail as needed. You can always refine your milestones as the project progresses.

## What makes a good milestone

Effective milestones share these characteristics:

**Clear deliverable** — Each milestone should represent a specific, tangible outcome or achievement.

**Meaningful progress** — Milestones should mark significant steps forward in your project, not just arbitrary dates.

**Realistic timeline** — Set target dates that are achievable given your resources and constraints.

**Measurable completion** — It should be clear when a milestone is done versus still in progress.

**Team alignment** — Milestones should be meaningful to everyone working on the project.
