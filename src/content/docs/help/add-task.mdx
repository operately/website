Tasks are the building blocks of your project work. They help you break down milestones into specific, actionable items that can be assigned, tracked, and completed by team members.

**Note:** Tasks are always associated with a milestone. If you don't have milestones yet, consider creating them first to organize your work effectively.

## Adding a task

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Tasks** tab
2. Find the milestone you want to add a task to and click the **+** icon
4. Enter a name for your task
5. Assign the task to a team member (optional)
6. Set a due date (optional)
8. Click **Create task**
</Steps>

## Adding tasks from the milestone page

You can also create tasks directly from a milestone page:

<Steps>
1. Open the milestone page
2. Click the **+** icon in the tasks section
3. Enter a name for your task
6. Click **Add** to create the task
</Steps>

## Managing tasks

Once created, you can:

- **Assign to team members** to clarify ownership and responsibility
- **Set due dates** to coordinate timing and dependencies
- **Add a description** to provide additional context and requirements
- **Mark as complete** when the work is finished
- **Move between milestones** if project scope or organization changes

This approach helps you maintain clear visibility into who's doing what and when, while keeping work organized under the appropriate milestones.

## What makes a good task

Effective tasks share these characteristics:

**Specific and actionable** — Each task should describe exactly what needs to be done.

**Appropriately sized** — Tasks should be small enough to complete in a reasonable timeframe, typically a few hours to a few days.

**Clear ownership** — It should be obvious who is responsible for completing the task.

**Measurable completion** — There should be a clear definition of when the task is considered done.

**Contributes to milestone** — Each task should clearly advance progress toward completing its parent milestone.
