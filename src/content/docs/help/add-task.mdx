Tasks are the building blocks of your project work. They help you break down milestones into specific, actionable items that can be assigned, tracked, and completed by team members.

## Adding a task

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Tasks** tab
2. Find the milestone you want to add a task to and click the **+** icon, or press the 'c' key as a shortcut
3. Enter a name for your task
4. Click/tap **Add**
</Steps>

## Adding tasks from the milestone page

You can also create tasks directly from a milestone page:

<Steps>
1. Open the milestone page
2. Click the **+** icon in the tasks section, or press the 'c' key as a shortcut
3. Enter a name for your task
6. Click **Add** to create the task
</Steps>

## Managing tasks

Once created, you can:

- **Assign to team members** to clarify ownership and responsibility
- **Set due date** to coordinate timing and dependencies
- **Add a description** to provide additional context and requirements
- **Update status** as work progresses (Not started → In progress → Done, or Canceled if no longer needed)
- **Move between milestones** if project scope or organization changes

This approach helps you maintain clear visibility into who's doing what and when, while keeping work organized under the appropriate milestones.
