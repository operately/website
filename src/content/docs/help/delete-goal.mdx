Deleting a goal permanently removes it from Operately. This action cannot be undone, so use it carefully.

## Deleting a goal

<Steps>
1. Open the goal page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, click **Delete**
3. Review the warning message about permanent deletion
4. Click **Delete Forever** to confirm
</Steps>

## What gets deleted

**Goal details** — All targets, descriptions, and settings.

**Progress history** — All check-ins, updates, and progress data.

**Discussions** — All comments and conversations related to the goal.

**Activity** — All activity records and audit trails.

**Relationships** — Links to parent goals, sub-goals, and projects.

## When to delete vs. close

**Delete** — Use when a goal was created by mistake, is completely irrelevant, or contains sensitive information that needs to be permanently removed.

**Close** — Use when a goal is complete or no longer relevant but you want to preserve the history and insights.

## Considerations before deleting

**Impact on other work** — Check if the goal is linked to parent goals or has sub-goals that might be affected.

**Team communication** — Let relevant team members know about the deletion.

**Data preservation** — Export any important information before deleting.

**Alternative approaches** — Consider closing the goal instead to preserve history.

## Recovery

Once a goal is deleted, it cannot be recovered. The deletion is permanent and affects all users who had access to the goal.
