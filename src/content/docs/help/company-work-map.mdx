- **Progress:** Visual indicator of completion percentage
- **Due Date:** When the work is scheduled to be completed

Note: When viewing the "Completed" tab, the columns change to show: Name, Status, Completed On, Space, and Champion.

## Filtering and navigating the Company Work Map

Use the tabs at the top of the Work Map to filter the view:

- **All:** Shows all goals and projects
- **Goals:** Shows only goals
- **Projects:** Shows only projects
