Project discussions work the same way as [space discussions](/help/start-discussion) but are scoped to the specific project. Use them to share updates, ask questions, or get feedback from your team.

## Starting a discussion

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Discussions** tab
2. Click **Start discussion**
3. Write your message using the rich text editor
4. If the project has contributors, choose who to notify about the discussion
5. Click **Post Discussion** to publish
</Steps>

## When to use project discussions

**Progress updates** — Share non-check-in updates, milestone achievements, or quick wins.

**Questions** — Ask for clarification, input, or decisions about project scope or approach.

**Feedback requests** — Get team input on deliverables, approaches, or challenges.

**Collaboration** — Coordinate with team members, contributors, and stakeholders working on the project.

**Issue resolution** — Discuss blockers, risks, or problems that need team attention.

## Discussion features

Project discussions include all the same features as space discussions:

- Rich text formatting and attachments
- Notifications and mentions
- Comment threads
- Activity tracking

For detailed information about discussions, see the [Discussions section](/help/start-discussion).
