Projects always live inside a space. You can control project access at three layers:

- **Company members** baseline
- **Space members** baseline
- **Contributors** (direct project-level grants)

## Access levels for projects

| Access Level       | What it allows |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| **No Access**      | Cannot see or access the project. |
| **View Access**    | Can view everything in the project, including overview, milestones, tasks, check-ins, discussions, and activity. |
| **Comment Access** | Includes View Access, plus commenting on tasks, discussions, check-ins, and other commentable resources. |
| **Edit Access**    | Includes Comment Access, plus editing project name, description, parent goal, and dates; adding or editing milestones, tasks, resources, check-ins, and discussions; pausing and closing the project; and adding or editing contributors. |
| **Full Access**    | Includes Edit Access, plus deleting the project, moving it to another space, and managing project-wide and contributor access settings. |

## How access is resolved

When a person matches more than one project rule, Operately applies the most permissive access level.

Example: if company members have **No Access**, space members have **Comment Access**, and the person is a contributor with **Edit Access**, the person gets **Edit Access**.

## Configuring project access

1. Open the project and go to the **Overview** tab.
2. Click **Manage team & access** in the sidebar.
3. Set baseline access for **Company members** and **Space members**.
4. Add or update **Contributors** with direct access levels.

## Contributors

Contributors are specific people granted direct project access and responsibilities.

- Use contributors when someone needs project access that differs from baseline rules.
- Contributors can be granted **View**, **Comment**, **Edit**, or **Full** direct access.
- Remove a contributor when they should no longer have direct project access.
- If someone has **Edit Access**, they can add and edit other contributors, but cannot grant contributor access above **Edit Access** and they cannot edit contributors with higher access levels.

For contributor management steps, see [Manage project contributors](/help/manage-project-contributors).

<Aside type="note">
Setting both company and space member baselines to <strong>No Access</strong> makes the project effectively hidden except for explicitly added contributors.
