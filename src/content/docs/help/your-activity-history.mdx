Your profile includes two tabs that help you track your history and contributions: Completed and Activity. Together, they give you a comprehensive view of your work over time.

## The Completed tab

The Completed tab shows all the goals and projects you've finished. This is your track record — the work you've accomplished and can be proud of.

### What you'll see in the Completed tab:

- **Name** — The title of the completed goal or project
- **Status** — Final status (Completed, Canceled, etc.)
- **Completed On** — The date when the work was finished
- **Space** — Which team or department the work belonged to
- **Champion** — The person who led the work

### When to use the Completed tab:

**Performance reviews** — Show your accomplishments and contributions over time.

**Portfolio building** — Demonstrate your track record of successful work.

**Reflection and learning** — Review past work to understand what went well and what you'd do differently.

**Planning future work** — Use your completed work to inform what you take on next.

## The Activity tab

The Activity tab shows a chronological record of everything you've done in Operately. This is your personal audit trail — every update, comment, document creation, and action you've taken.

### What you'll see in the Activity tab:

- **Timeline** — Activities organized by date, with the most recent at the top
- **Action descriptions** — What you did (e.g., "Submitted check-in", "Created document", "Added comment")
- **Context** — Which goal, project, or space the activity relates to
