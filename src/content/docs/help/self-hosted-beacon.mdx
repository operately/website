description: Learn about Operately's beacon system, how it works, and how to disable it.
---

Operately includes a beacon system that helps us understand how the software is
being used and improve the product. This page explains how the beacon works and
how you can disable it if needed.

## What is the beacon?

The beacon is a lightweight telemetry system that periodically sends anonymous
usage statistics to Operately's servers.

## What data is collected?

The beacon collects only two pieces of information:

- **Version**: The application version number (e.g., v1.1.0)
- **Installation ID**: A randomly generated, non-identifying ID used only to deduplicate and count unique instances

No other data is collected. No personal, content, or authentication data is
transmitted.

## What data is NOT collected?

The beacon does not collect:

- Personal information (names, emails, addresses)
- Content data (goal titles, project descriptions, messages)
- Authentication credentials
- IP addresses or location data
- Individual user behavior or activity

## How does the beacon work?

The beacon operates by:

1. **Collecting metrics**: Gathering anonymous usage statistics locally
2. **Aggregating data**: Combining data into anonymous summaries
3. **Periodic transmission**: Sending data once per day to Operately servers
4. **Automatic retry**: Retrying failed transmissions with exponential backoff

The beacon uses HTTPS encryption for all data transmission and respects your
network configuration and firewall rules.

## How to disable the beacon

To disable the beacon, set the following environment variable in your deployment:

```bash
OPERATELY_BEACON_ENABLED=false
```

After setting this environment variable, you must restart your Docker containers
for the change to take effect.

## Privacy considerations

We take privacy seriously and are committed to:

- **Transparency**: Being clear about what data is collected
- **Minimalism**: Collecting only what's necessary for product improvement
- **Security**: Using encryption and secure transmission methods
- **Control**: Providing easy ways to disable data collection
