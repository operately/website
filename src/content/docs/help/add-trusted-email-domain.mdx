Trusted email domains allow users with email addresses from those specific domains (e.g., `yourcompany.com`) to sign up for your organization automatically, without needing a manual invitation.

<Aside type="note" title="Tip for Google Sign-In Users">
This feature is particularly useful if your organization primarily uses Google Sign-In with your company's domain (e.g., Google Workspace). Adding your company domain here allows team members to sign up seamlessly using their Google account without needing an explicit invitation.

## Who can manage trusted domains?

Only account owners can add or remove trusted email domains.

## How to add a trusted email domain

<Steps>
1.  Click on your organization name in the top navigation bar to open the company menu.
2.  Select **Company Admin** from the dropdown menu.
3.  Under the "As an owner, you can:" section, click **Manage trusted email domains**.
4.  On the "Trusted Email Domains" page, locate the "Add Trusted Email Domain" input field.
5.  Enter the email domain you want to trust (e.g., `example.com`). Do not include `@`.

</Steps>

The domain will be added to the list of trusted domains. Users signing up with an email address from this domain can now join the organization without an explicit invitation.
