Outside collaborators are people outside your company who need access to specific goals, projects, or spaces. Unlike team members, they don't receive default access to company resources.

## Who can invite outside collaborators?

Company owners and administrators have permission to invite outside collaborators to the organization.

## How to invite an outside collaborator

There are three quick ways to access the invitation form:

### Method 1: Via the Homepage

1. From the homepage, click on **Invite People**.

## Outside collaborators and access

Outside collaborators do not get access to company resources by default. You must give them explicit access to the goals, projects, or spaces they should work on.

## What happens next?

- **If the person already has an Operately account**, they will be added to your organization as an outside collaborator with no default permissions, and they will receive an email notification.

- **If the person does not have an Operately account**, Operately will generate a unique invitation link after you submit the form. Copy and share that link with them so they can join your organization. They'll also receive an email that includes the link.

## Managing pending invitations

While an invitation is waiting for a response, you can manage it from the "Manage Team Members" page.

Find the person you invited:

- **Re-issue Invitation**: If the original invitation link expired or was lost, click the **...** menu next to the person's name and select **Re-Issue Invitation** to generate a new link.
- **Revoke Invitation**: If you need to cancel the invitation before the person accepts, click the **...** menu and select **Revoke Invitation**. This will invalidate the invitation link and remove the pending invitation.
