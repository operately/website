Outside collaborators are people outside your company who need access to specific goals, projects, or spaces. Unlike team members, they don't receive default access to company resources.

## Who can invite outside collaborators?

Company owners and administrators have permission to invite outside collaborators to the organization.

## How to invite an outside collaborator

There are three quick ways to access the invitation form:

### Method 1: Via the Homepage

1. From the homepage, click on **Invite People**.

Outside collaborators do not get access to company resources by default. However, you can grant them explicit access to the resources they should work on at any moment.

## Learn more about managing access

For detailed instructions on how to manage access to specific resource types, see:

- [Add a Space Member](/help/add-space-member)
- [Manage project contributors](/help/manage-project-contributors)
- [Manage goal access](/help/manage-goal-access)

## What happens next?

- **If the person already has an Operately account**, they will be added to your organization as an outside collaborator with no default permissions, and they will receive an email notification.

- **If the person does not have an Operately account**, Operately will generate a unique invitation link after you submit the form. Copy and share that link with them so they can join your organization. They'll also receive an email that includes the link.

## Managing pending invitations

While an invitation is waiting for a response, you can manage it from the "Manage Team Members" page.

Find the person you invited:

- **Reissue Invitation**: If the original invitation link expired or was lost, click the **...** menu next to the person's name and select **Re-Issue Invitation** to generate a new link.
- **Revoke Invitation**: If you need to cancel the invitation before the person accepts, click the **...** menu and select **Revoke Invitation**. This will invalidate the invitation link and remove the pending invitation.
