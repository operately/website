Operately permissions are built around five selectable access states:

- **No Access**
- **View Access**
- **Comment Access**
- **Edit Access**
- **Full Access**

## Permission levels

| Access Level       | What it means |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| **No Access**      | The resource is hidden and cannot be accessed. |
| **View Access**    | Can open and read the resource and its content. |
| **Comment Access** | Includes View Access, plus posting comments on resources such as tasks, discussions and check-ins. |
| **Edit Access**    | Includes Comment Access, plus editing content and creating/updating work inside the resource. |
| **Full Access**    | Includes Edit Access, plus deletion and permission-management actions. |

## Space permissions

For each space, you can configure:

- **Company-wide access** for all company members
- **Individual member access** for explicitly added space members

Setting company-wide access to **No Access** makes the space secret. In that case, only explicitly granted members can see or use it.

See full details in [Space access control](/help/space-access-control).

## Goal permissions

Every goal lives inside a space. For each goal, you can configure:

- **Company members** baseline access
- **Space members** baseline access
- **Direct people access** for specific company members

A person’s final goal access comes from the most permissive applicable grant.

See full details in [Goal permissions](/help/set-goal-privacy) and [Manage goal access](/help/manage-goal-access).

## Project permissions

Every project lives inside a space. For each project, you can configure:

- **Company members** baseline access
- **Space members** baseline access
- **Contributor access** for specific contributors

A person’s final project access comes from the most permissive applicable grant.

See full details in [Project permissions](/help/project-access-control) and [Manage project contributors](/help/manage-project-contributors).

## Examples

1. **Secret space with exceptions**
   Company members = **No Access**. One explicitly added member = **Edit Access**. That member can access and edit the space.
2. **Goal with layered access**
   Company members = **View Access**. Space members = **Comment Access**. A space member gets **Comment Access**.
3. **Project with direct override**
   Company members = **No Access**. Space members = **No Access**. A contributor is granted **Full Access**. That contributor gets **Full Access**.

<Aside type="tip">
When possible, start with lower baseline access and add direct/contributor grants only where needed. This keeps permissions easier to audit and reason about.
