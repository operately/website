Use space access control to decide:

- What all company members can do in the space
- What explicitly added space members can do in the space

## Access levels for spaces

#### No Access

Users cannot see or access the space.

#### View Access

Users can see the space and its accessible content, including documents, tasks, and non-secret goals and projects.

#### Comment Access

Includes View Access, plus commenting on tasks, discussions, documents, and other commentable resources.

#### Edit Access

Includes Comment Access, plus the ability to:

- Edit the space name and purpose
- Enable or disable space tools
- Create discussions
- Create projects
- Create goals
- Create documents, files and links

#### Full Access

Includes Edit Access, plus the ability to:

- Delete the space
- Manage company-wide access settings
- Manage individual member access settings

## Company-wide vs. individual member access

Each space has two main permission layers:

- **Company-wide access**: baseline access for all company members
- **Member access**: explicit access for individually added space members

If someone receives both, Operately applies the most permissive access level.

## Secret spaces

Set company-wide access to **No Access** to make a space secret. Only people with explicit space-level access can see and interact with the space.

## Space managers

People with **Full Access** can manage access, including:

- Changing company-wide access
- Adding or removing members
- Promoting or reassigning space managers

<Aside type="tip">
A practical approach is to keep company-wide access broad enough for transparency, then grant higher individual access only to people actively working inside the space.
