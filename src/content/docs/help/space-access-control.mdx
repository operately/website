Use space access management to decide:

- What all company members can do in the space
- What explicitly added space members can do in the space

## Access levels for spaces

| Access Level       | What it allows |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| **No Access**      | Cannot see or access the space. |
| **View Access**    | Can see the space and its accessible content, including documents, tasks, and non-secret goals and projects. |
| **Comment Access** | Includes View Access, plus commenting on tasks, discussions, documents, and other commentable resources. |
| **Edit Access**    | Includes Comment Access, plus editing space name and description, enabling or disabling tools, and creating content such as discussions, projects, goals, documents, and files. |
| **Full Access**    | Includes Edit Access, plus deleting the space and managing company-wide and individual member access levels. |

## Company-wide vs. individual member access

Each space has two main permission layers:

- **Company-wide access**: baseline access for all company members
- **Member access**: explicit access for individually added space members

If someone receives both, Operately applies the most permissive access level.

## Secret spaces

Set company-wide access to **No Access** to make a space secret. Only people with explicit space-level access can see and interact with the space.

## Space managers

People with **Full Access** can manage access, including:

- Changing company-wide access
- Adding or removing members
- Promoting or reassigning space managers

<Aside type="tip">
A practical approach is to keep company-wide access broad enough for transparency, then grant higher individual access only to people actively working inside the space.
