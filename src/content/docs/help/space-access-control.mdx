Operately makes it easy to control who can see and work in your [spaces](/help/intro-to-spaces). We believe in transparency, so by default, anyone in your company can view what's happening in a space.

You can change who can access your space via the **Manage Access** section of any space.

### Understanding access levels

You can set different access levels for:

- Everyone in your company
- Specific people you invite as members of the space

Here's what each access level means:

| Access Level       | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **View Access**    | • Can see everything in the space<br />• Can't edit or comment<br />• Can't add new content                                          |
| **Comment Access** | • Can see everything in the space<br />• Can leave comments<br />• Can't create or edit content<br />• Can't add or remove members     |
| **Edit Access**    | • Can edit space content<br />• Can add new members<br />• Can't see invite-only content<br />• Can't change who manages the space     |
| **Full Access**    | • Complete control of the space<br />• Can manage all content<br />• Can control who has access<br />• Can assign space managers |

When we say "content", we mean anything that can be created in the space, such as:

- Goals
- Discussions
- Projects
- Documents
- Files and attachments

**Space managers** are trusted members with full access who can:

- Invite new people
- Create content
- Control access settings
- See and manage all projects in the space

<Aside type="tip">Be selective about who you add as space members. Members should be active contributors who work on the space's goals and projects, not just occasional readers. A good way to decide: since members get notifications about new messages, ask yourself "Would this person need to know about and respond to updates in this space?" If not, they probably don't need to be a member.</Aside>
