Each goal is created inside a space. Goal permissions combine three layers:

- **Company members** baseline access
- **Space members** baseline access
- **Direct people access** for specific company members

## Access levels for goals

#### No Access

Users cannot see or access the goal.

#### View Access

Users can view everything in the goal, including discussions, check-ins, and activity feed.

#### Comment Access

Includes View Access, plus commenting on check-ins, discussions, and other commentable resources.

#### Edit Access

Includes Comment Access, plus the ability to:

- Edit the goal name, description, parent goal, and start and due dates
- Close the goal
- Add and edit targets
- Add and edit checklist items
- Add and edit check-ins
- Add and edit discussions

#### Full Access

Includes Edit Access, plus the ability to:

- Delete the goal
- Move the goal to another space
- Manage goal-wide access settings
- Manage direct people access settings

## How access is resolved

When multiple grants apply, Operately uses the most permissive access level.

Example: if company members have **View Access**, space members have **Comment Access**, and the person has direct **Edit Access**, the person gets **Edit Access**.

## How to set baseline goal permissions

<Steps>
1. Open the goal and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, find the **Privacy** section
3. Open the permissions dialog
4. Choose access levels for **Company members** and **Space members**
5. Save your changes
</Steps>

## How to manage direct people access

Use **Manage access** on the goal sidebar to grant direct access to specific company members.

For step-by-step instructions, see [Manage goal access](/help/manage-goal-access).

<Aside type="note">
Setting both company and space-member baselines to <strong>No Access</strong> makes the goal hidden unless someone receives direct goal access.
