Each goal is created inside a space. Goal permissions combine three layers:

- **Company members** baseline access
- **Space members** baseline access
- **Direct people access** for specific company members

## Access levels for goals

| Access Level       | What it allows |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| **No Access**      | Cannot see or access the goal. |
| **View Access**    | Can view everything in the goal, including discussions, check-ins, and activity feed. |
| **Comment Access** | Includes View Access, plus commenting on check-ins, discussions, and other commentable resources. |
| **Edit Access**    | Includes Comment Access, plus editing goal name, description, parent goal, and dates; closing the goal; and adding or editing targets, checklist items, check-ins, and discussions. |
| **Full Access**    | Includes Edit Access, plus deleting the goal, moving it to another space, and managing goal-wide and direct people access settings. |

## How access is resolved

When multiple grants apply, Operately uses the most permissive access level.

Example: Company members = **View Access**, space members = **Comment Access**, direct access = **Edit Access**. Effective goal access is **Edit Access**.

## How to set baseline goal permissions

<Steps>
1. Open the goal and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, find the **Privacy** section
3. Open the permissions dialog
4. Choose access levels for **Company members** and **Space members**
5. Save your changes
</Steps>

## How to manage direct people access

Use **Manage access** on the goal sidebar to grant direct access to specific company members.

For step-by-step instructions, see [Manage goal access](/help/manage-goal-access).

<Aside type="note">
Setting both company and space-member baselines to <strong>No Access</strong> makes the goal hidden unless someone receives direct goal access.
