Goal privacy settings control who can see and interact with your goal. You can set different access levels for company members and space members.

## Setting privacy

<Steps>
1. Open the goal page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, find the **Privacy** section
3. Click the privacy setting to open the privacy dialog
4. Choose access levels for company members and space members
5. Click **Save** to apply the settings
</Steps>

## Access levels

**No Access** — People cannot see the goal at all.

**View Access** — People can see the goal but cannot comment or edit.

**Comment Access** — People can see the goal and add comments, but cannot edit the goal details.

**Edit Access** — People can see, comment on, and edit the goal details.

**Full Access** — People have complete control over the goal, including deleting it.

## Default settings

Most goals use the default "Company members can comment, space members can edit" setting. This promotes transparency while giving space members more control over their work.

## When to adjust privacy

**Sensitive work** — Use more restrictive settings for confidential or strategic goals.

**Cross-team collaboration** — Give broader access when multiple teams need to contribute.

**Public goals** — Use open settings for company-wide initiatives that everyone should see.

**Private work** — Restrict access for early-stage work that's not ready for broader visibility.
