Joining an Operately organization allows you to collaborate with your team, track shared goals, and manage projects together. You'll typically join an organization after being invited by an administrator.

## How joining works

The process depends on whether you already have an Operately account:

### If you received an invitation link (for new users)

If you don't have an Operately account yet, an administrator will likely send you a unique invitation link:

<Steps>
1. Click on the invitation link you received (it's valid for 24 hours).
2. This will take you to the Operately sign-up page.
3. Follow the steps to create a new account.
4. Once your account is created, you'll be automatically added to the organization that invited you.
5. You'll land on the organization's home page.

</Steps>

### If you already have an Operately account

If you already use Operately (perhaps with another organization), an administrator can invite you using your existing account email:

<Steps>
1. You'll receive an email notification confirming you've been added to the new organization.
2. You are automatically added â€“ there's usually no separate acceptance step required.
3. The next time you log in, or by using the ["Switch Company" feature](/help/switch-organization-account), you'll be able to access the new organization.
</Steps>

## Accessing the new organization

Once you've joined:

- You'll see the organization's spaces, goals, projects, and team members based on your access level.
- If you're a member of more than one organization, you can access the new organization by selecting it from the Lobby screen after clicking ["Switch Company"](/help/switch-organization-account) in the company menu dropdown.

If you were expecting an invitation but haven't received it, please contact the administrator who invited you.
