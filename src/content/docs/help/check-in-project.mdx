Check-ins are weekly progress updates that champions provide on their projects. They include status updates and communicate any blockers or achievements.

## Weekly check-ins

Operately prompts [champions](/help/assign-goal-champion) to check-in at least once per week. This ensures regular progress tracking and keeps [reviewers](/help/assign-goal-reviewer) informed about project status.

## How to check-in on a project

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Check-ins** tab
2. Click **Check-In Now**
3. On the check-in page, select the status: **On track**, **Caution**, or **Off track**
4. Write your check-in 
5. If the project has contributors, select who should be notified about the check-in (the reviewer is always notified)
6. Click **Submit** to publish your check-in
</Steps>

## Project status

All newly created projects start with an 'pending' status. When submitting check-ins, you can choose from these status options:

**On track** — Progressing as planned. No blockers.

**Caution** — Emerging risks or delays. Reviewer should be aware.

**Off track** — Significant problems affecting success. Reviewer's help is needed.

## Reviewer acknowledgment

After submitting a check-in, the reviewer must explicitly acknowledge it by clicking **Acknowledge this Check-In**. This ensures the reviewer has seen and acknowledged the update.

## Additional check-ins

While regular check-ins are encouraged, you can submit additional check-ins anytime significant progress is made or when urgent updates are needed.

## After submitting a check-in

- **Status visibility**: The project status will be updated and visible to all team members
- **Team notifications**: Selected contributors and the reviewer will be notified about the new check-in
- **Progress tracking**: Check-ins help maintain project momentum and transparency
- **Historical record**: All check-ins are preserved for future reference and project reviews
