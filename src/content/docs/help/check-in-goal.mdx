Check-ins are monthly progress updates that champions provide on their goals. They include status updates, target progress, and narrative updates about wins, obstacles, and needs.

## Monthly check-ins

Operately prompts [champions](/help/assign-goal-champion) to check-in at least once per month. This ensures regular progress tracking and keeps [reviewers](/help/assign-goal-reviewer) informed about goal status.

## Providing a check-in

<Steps>
1. Open the goal page and go to the **Check-Ins** tab
2. Click **Check-In Now** to start a new check-in
3. Update the goal status (On track, Caution, or Off track)
4. Update target values with current progress
5. Add narrative updates about key wins, obstacles, and needs
6. Choose who to notify about the check-in
7. Click **Check-in** to submit
</Steps>

## Goal status lifecycle

**Pending** — All newly created goals start with a 'pending' status. This status remains until the champion submits their first check-in.

## Status options

Once you submit your first check-in, you can choose from these status options:

**On track** — Progressing as planned. No blockers.

**Caution** — Emerging risks or delays. Reviewer should be aware.

**Off track** — Significant problems affecting success. Reviewer's help is needed.

## Target updates

Update the current values for each target to reflect actual progress. Target updates should happen continuously as progress is made, not just during monthly check-ins.

## Narrative updates

Use the rich text editor to provide context about:

**Key wins** — Successful milestones, positive outcomes, and achievements.

**Obstacles** — Challenges, blockers, or issues that need attention.

**Needs** — Resources, support, or decisions needed to move forward.

## Reviewer acknowledgment

After submitting a check-in, the reviewer must explicitly acknowledge it by clicking **Acknowledge this Check-In**. This ensures the reviewer has seen and acknowledged the update.

## Additional check-ins

While monthly check-ins are required, you can submit additional check-ins anytime significant progress is made or when urgent updates are needed.

## Continuous target updates

Don't wait for monthly check-ins to update target values. Update them continuously as you make progress to keep the goal's progress bar accurate and up-to-date.
