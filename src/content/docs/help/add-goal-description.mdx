A good goal description provides context and clarity for your team. It explains why the goal matters, what success looks like, and any important constraints or considerations.

**Note:** Not having a description is absolutely fine in many cases, especially for short-term goals with limited scope where the targets tell the whole story.

## Adding a goal description

<Steps>
1. Open the goal page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the **Goal Description** section, click the **Write** button
3. Use the rich text editor to write your description
4. Click **Save** to add the description to your goal
</Steps>

## What to include in your description

A good goal description provides context and background information:

**Context** — Why this goal matters to your business or team. What problem does it solve?

**Background** — The situation that led to this goal. What changed that made this necessary?

**Decision making** — Why this approach was chosen over alternatives. What assumptions underlie the goal?

**Stakeholders** — Who is affected by this goal? Who needs to be involved or informed?

**Constraints** — Any limitations, deadlines, or requirements that affect how you approach the goal.

## Using the rich text editor

The goal description editor provides formatting options to help you organize your content. For detailed information about using the rich text editor, see [Format text and embed images](/help/format-document-text).

## Tips for writing effective descriptions

**Focus on context** — The description should provide background and reasoning, not duplicate what targets already measure.

**Think long-term** — Write for your future self who might revisit this goal months later and need to remember the original context.

**Document decisions** — Include the reasoning behind key decisions and assumptions that shaped the goal.

**Keep it concise** — While you want to be comprehensive, avoid unnecessary detail. Focus on what matters most.

**Update when needed** — As circumstances change, update the description to reflect new context or understanding.

A well-written goal description provides the context and background that helps teams understand why the work matters and how decisions were made.
