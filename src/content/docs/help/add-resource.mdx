Resources help you organize and share important documents, links, and files related to your project. They provide easy access to everything your team needs to succeed.

## How to add a resource

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. Click **Add resource**
3. Enter the URL of the resource
4. Enter a title for your resource
6. Click **Save**
</Steps>

## Managing resources

Once created, you can:

- **Edit** them to update titles or links
- **Delete** resources that are no longer needed
- **Share links** to specific resources with team members

Resources keep your project documentation centralized and accessible, making it easier for your team to find what they need when they need it.
