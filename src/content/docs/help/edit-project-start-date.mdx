Changing a project's start date helps you adjust timelines and ensure your project schedule aligns with current priorities and resource availability.

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Overview** tab

3. Click on the start date area (or current start date if one exists)
4. Select a new date from the date picker
5. Click **Confirm** to save the change
</Steps>

## When to change start dates

Consider updating a project's start date when:

- **Resource availability** - Team members or resources become available earlier or later
- **Priority shifts** - Project urgency has changed based on business needs
- **Dependency changes** - Prerequisites or blockers have been resolved or introduced
- **Timeline adjustments** - Overall project schedule needs to be realigned

Keeping project start dates accurate ensures realistic scheduling and helps teams plan their work effectively across your organization.
