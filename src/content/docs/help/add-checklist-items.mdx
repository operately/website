Checklists help you track key milestones and deliverables that don't need to be measured numerically. Perfect for goals with important qualitative outcomes or major accomplishments that matter more than metrics.

While targets should be the ultimate measure of completion on a goal, checklists serve as supplementary tracking for important milestones along the way.

Checklist completion will be calculated into the overall progress of the goal together with targets.

## Adding a checklist item

<Steps>
1. Open the goal page and go to the **Overview** tab 
2. In the **Checklist** section, click the **Add** button 
3. Enter the checklist item name and click **Add Check**
</Steps>

## What makes a good checklist item

Each checklist item should represent a meaningful outcome or result:

**Business outcomes** — "Secure Series A funding round" or "Launch in European market"

**Key results** — "Sign partnership with major retailer" or "Obtain FDA approval"

**Success criteria** — "Pass security audit" or "Win industry award for innovation"

**Value delivery** — "Go live with premium tier" or "Enable mobile app access"

## Managing checklist items

Once you've created checklist items, you can:

<Steps>
1. **Mark as complete** — Check the box next to any completed item 
2. **Edit items** — Hover over the item, click the three dots on the right, and choose Edit 
3. **Remove items** — Hover over the item, click the three dots on the right, and choose Delete
</Steps>

## Tips for effective checklists

**Focus on outcomes** — Each item should represent something meaningful being accomplished, not just busy work.

**Make them binary** — Items should be clearly either done or not done. Avoid ambiguous descriptions.

**Keep them actionable** — Write items as specific actions that can be taken and completed.

**Limit the scope** — Don't break things down too granularly. Focus on significant milestones.

**Review regularly** — Update your checklist as priorities change or new requirements emerge.

**Complement targets** — Use checklists alongside numerical targets to track both quantitative and qualitative progress.

Checklists provide a flexible way to track progress on goals where traditional metrics don't capture the full picture. They help you celebrate important milestones and maintain momentum toward your goal.
