The Review page in Operately brings together all your responsibilities in one convenient location. It shows actions you need to take, whether you're responsible for providing updates as a champion or acknowledging others' work as a reviewer.

## Accessing the Review page

<Steps>
1.  Look for the **Review** icon in the top navigation bar.
2.  Click on it to open your personalized Review page.
</Steps>

## Understanding the Review page layout

The Review page is organized into two main sections:

### 1. MY WORK (Due updates you are responsible for as a champion)

This section displays all the updates you need to provide as a champion of goals, projects, or other initiatives. For each item, you'll see:

*   **Due date:** When the update should be completed by
*   **Type of update:** Check-in, progress update, etc.
*   **Name of the item:** The goal, project, or initiative that needs your attention

When an item appears here, it means it's time for you to provide an update. Clicking on any item takes you directly to the appropriate form to submit your update, such as:

*   Weekly check-ins for projects
*   Monthly progress updates for goals
*   Other types of regular updates you're responsible for

### 2. FOR REVIEW (Updates from others needing your acknowledgment)

This section shows items that others have submitted and are waiting for your review or acknowledgment. As a manager or designated reviewer, you'll see:

*   **Submission date:** When the item was submitted
*   **Type of review:** What kind of update needs your attention
*   **Who submitted it:** The team member who provided the update
*   **Name of the item:** The goal, project, or initiative in question

Clicking on these items takes you directly to the submitted update where you can review the content and acknowledge it.

## Benefits of using the Review page

*   **Stay organized:** See all your responsibilities in one place
*   **Never miss updates:** Clear indicators of what needs your attention
*   **Save time:** Direct links to the forms or content you need to act on
*   **Maintain accountability:** Regular reminders of your commitments and responsibilities

## Managing your due actions

*   **Items automatically disappear:** Once you complete an action (submitting a check-in as a champion or acknowledging an update as a reviewer), the item will disappear from your list.
*   **Goal is zero items:** The ideal state is to have no items in your Review list, indicating you've addressed all your responsibilities.
*   **Daily email reminders:** Each morning, you'll receive an email digest summarizing all the items currently on your Review page, helping you plan your day and prioritize your actions.
