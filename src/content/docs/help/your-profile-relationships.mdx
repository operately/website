The About tab shows your personal information and organizational relationships. This is where you can understand your place in the company structure and find the right people to connect with.

## What you'll see in the About tab

The About tab is organized into two main sections:

### Contact Information

Your basic contact details:
- **Email address** — How others can reach you directly
- **Profile picture** — Your visual identity across the platform
- **Name and title** — How you're identified in the organization

### Colleagues Section

A visual representation of your organizational relationships:

**Peers** — Other team members who share your manager. These are people at your same level in the organization.

**Reports** — Team members who report to you (if you're a manager). These are people you have oversight responsibility for.

**Manager** — Your direct supervisor (if applicable). This is the person you report to.

## Understanding organizational relationships

The colleagues section helps you navigate the organizational structure:

- **Find the right person** — When you need to escalate an issue or get approval, you know who to contact
- **Understand your team** — See who your peers are and who reports to you
