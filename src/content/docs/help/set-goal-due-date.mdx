Setting a due date helps your team understand when the goal should be completed. This creates urgency, enables better planning, and helps with prioritization across your organization.

## Setting a due date

<Steps>
1. Open the goal page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, find the **Due Date** section
3. Click **Set date** to open the date picker
4. Choose the appropriate date type and select your target date
5. Click **Confirm** to set the due date
</Steps>

## Date type options

The date picker offers four different granularities to match your goal's timeline:

**Day** — For specific deadlines. Choose a particular day when the goal should be completed.

**Month** — For broader timeframes. Useful when you need flexibility within a month.

**Quarter** — For strategic goals. Perfect for quarterly planning and OKR-style goals.

**Year** — For long-term objectives. Use for annual goals or multi-year initiatives.

## When to use each date type

**Use Day for:**
- Specific deadlines
- Short-term goals (weeks to months)

**Use Month for:**
- Goals with some flexibility
- Initiatives that span multiple weeks
- When exact timing isn't critical

**Use Quarter for:**
- Strategic objectives
- OKR-style goals
- Team quarterly planning
- Goals that align with business cycles

**Use Year for:**
- Long-term strategic initiatives
- Annual objectives
- Multi-year projects
- Company-wide goals

## Managing due dates

**Updating due dates** — You can change a due date at any time by clicking **Set date** again and selecting a new date.

**Overdue goals** — Goals that pass their due date will be highlighted to help you identify what needs attention.

**Planning around due dates** — Use due dates to prioritize work and ensure resources are allocated appropriately.

## Tips for effective due dates

**Be realistic** — Set dates that are achievable given your team's capacity and other commitments.

**Consider dependencies** — Account for work that needs to happen before your goal can be completed.

**Align with business cycles** — Consider quarterly planning, annual reviews, and other organizational rhythms.

**Communicate changes** — If you need to adjust a due date, communicate the reason to stakeholders.

**Use for prioritization** — Due dates help you decide what to work on first when you have multiple goals.

**Balance urgency and quality** — Don't set unrealistic deadlines that compromise the quality of your work.

Due dates create accountability and help teams stay focused on what matters most. They're especially valuable when you have multiple goals competing for attention and resources.
