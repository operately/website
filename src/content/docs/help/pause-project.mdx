Pausing a project allows you to temporarily halt its progress while preserving all project data, milestones, and tasks. This is useful when you need to suspend work on a project for some time, but you intend to continue it later.

## How to pause a project

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. Click **Pause project** in the Actions section of the sidebar
3. On the new page, confirm by clicking **Pause project**
</Steps>

## After pausing a project

- **Project status changes**: The project will be marked as paused and listed in the Paused tab in Work Maps
- **Timeline preservation**: All milestones, tasks, and deadlines remain intact
- **Team notifications**: Project contributors will be notified about the pause
- **Check-in suspension**: The project champion will no longer be asked to check in
- **Resume project:** You can resume the project at any time using the "Resume project" action
