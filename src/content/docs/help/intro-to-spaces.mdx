Spaces help you organize work around natural team structures. Think of them as dedicated areas where teams collaborate on their goals and projects.

### Getting started with spaces

For most startups, create a space for each core department:

- Marketing: Brand, growth, and customer acquisition
- Product: Product strategy and development
- Engineering: Technical development and infrastructure
- Customer Success: User onboarding and growth
- Sales: Revenue and business development
- Finance: Budget and financial operations
- People: Hiring and team development
- Legal: Compliance and contracts

As your company grows, you might create more specific spaces like "Enterprise Sales" or "Platform Engineering" to match your evolving organization.

### What you'll find in each space

Every space includes:
- Goals: Track key objectives and measure progress
- Projects: Manage specific initiatives with clear timelines and deliverables
- Discussions: Share updates and have focused team conversations
- Documents & Files: Store and organize relevant documents and resources

### The Company space: Your central HQ

The Company space comes built-in and serves as your organization's shared home. Use it for:
- Company-wide announcements
- Cross-team initiatives
- Strategic planning
- Documentation that everyone needs

### Visibility and access

Spaces are open by default â€” anyone in your company can view and comment on what's happening. This promotes collaboration and keeps everyone informed.

Need privacy for sensitive work? You can make any space private using access management tools.

### Adding team members

Add people who actively work on your team's initiatives. They'll get notifications about:

- New goals and projects
- Team discussions
- Important documents
- Project updates

<Aside>People don't need to be added to a space to view its content (unless it's private). This keeps information flowing while keeping notifications focused on relevant team members.</Aside>
