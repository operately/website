When you [start a discussion](/help/start-discussion) in a Space or Goal, you have control over who gets notified about your new post. This helps ensure the right people see the information without overwhelming others.

Below the main content editor, you'll find the **When I post this, notify** section with the following options:

1.  **All [X] people who are members of the [Space/Goal name] space/goal**
    *   This is the default option.
    *   Everyone who is currently a member of the Space or Goal where you are posting will receive a notification.
    *   Use this for general announcements or topics relevant to the entire group.

2.  **Only the people I select**
    *   Choose this if your discussion is relevant only to specific individuals.
    *   Clicking this option reveals a link or button to **Select people to notify**.
    *   A modal window will appear, allowing you to search for and select specific team members from the organization.
    *   You can select one or multiple people.
    *   Click **Save selection** in the modal.
    *   Only the selected individuals will receive a notification.

3.  **No one**
    *   Choose this if you are posting something for documentation purposes or don't need to actively alert anyone immediately.
    *   No notifications will be sent out when you publish the discussion.
    *   Team members can still find the discussion by browsing the Space or Goal.

Select the option that best suits the audience and purpose of your discussion before clicking **Post discussion** or **Save as draft**.

  You can also notify specific people by at-mentioning them inside the body of your post.
