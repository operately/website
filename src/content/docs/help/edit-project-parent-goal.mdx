Changing a project's parent goal helps you reorganize your work structure and ensure projects are aligned with the right strategic objectives.

## How to edit the parent goal

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, find the **Parent Goal** section
3. Click on the parent goal area (or current parent goal if one exists)
4. If the project already has a parent goal, click **Choose another goal**
5. Select a goal from the dropdown menu
6. Click **Save** to confirm the change
</Steps>

## When to change parent goals

Consider updating a project's parent goal when:

- **Strategic realignment** - Company priorities have shifted
- **Better organization** - The project fits better under a different goal
- **Goal restructuring** - Parent goals have been reorganized
- **Clearer alignment** - A different goal better represents the project's purpose

## Managing goal hierarchies

Once updated, the project will:

- **Appear under the new parent goal** in work maps
- **Maintain its existing tasks and milestones** - only the organizational structure changes

Keeping projects properly aligned with their parent goals ensures clear strategic focus and accurate progress reporting across your organization.
