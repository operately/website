This guide walks you through updating a self-hosted installation of Operately to a newer version.

## Before you start

Log in to the server running Operately and navigate to the directory where Operately is running. By default this location is `~/operately`.

## Updating Operately

The update process depends on your current version:

- **Version 1.4.0 or later:** Use the `operately` update script
- **Before version 1.4.0:** Manually update the Docker Compose configuration

### If you're on version 1.4.0 or later

#### Using the operately script

To update to the latest official release without specifying a version:

```bash
./operately update
```

To update to a specific version:

```bash
./operately update <version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the version you want to upgrade to. For example:

```bash
./operately update 1.4.0
```

```bash
./operately update 1.5.0
```

You can also update to nightly builds:

```bash
./operately update nightly-build-20260116-070020-49842cd04
```

#### If the script is not available

Depending on the Operately version you installed for the first time, the `operately` script might not be available. In that case, you need to generate it first:

```bash
docker compose run --rm app sh -c "/opt/operately/bin/generate-script" > operately
chmod +x operately
```

After generating the script, you can use the update commands above.

### If you're on a version before 1.4.0

You need to manually update the Docker Compose file.

#### Update the Docker Compose file

Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and update the Operately version tag:

```yaml
# From this:
image: operately/operately:vOLD

# To this:
image: operately/operately:vNEW
```

Replace `vOLD` with your current version and `vNEW` with the target version you want to upgrade to.

Examples:

```yaml
# From this:
image: operately/operately:1.2.0

# To this:
image: operately/operately:1.3.0
```

```yaml
# From this:
image: operately/operately:1.2.0

# To this:
image: operately/operately:nightly-build-20260116-070020-49842cd04
```

#### Run database migrations

```bash
docker compose run --rm app sh -c "/opt/operately/bin/migrate"
```

#### Restart the server

```bash
docker compose up --wait --detach
```
