Sometimes you may need to remove a discussion that's no longer relevant, contains incorrect information, or was posted by mistake. 

<Aside type="caution">
**Important:** Only the original author of a discussion can delete it. If you need a discussion removed but didn't create it, you'll need to contact the author.

## How to delete a discussion

<Steps>
1.  Navigate to the discussion you want to delete.
2.  Look for the "..." (three dots) menu in the top-right corner of the discussion post.
3.  Click on the "..." menu to open it.
4.  Select **Delete** from the dropdown menu.
5.  Confirm the deletion when prompted.
</Steps>

## What happens when you delete a discussion

*   The discussion and all its comments are permanently removed.
*   This action cannot be undone.
*   All subscribers will no longer see the discussion in their feeds or spaces.
*   Links to the deleted discussion will no longer work.

## Best practices

Before deleting a discussion, consider:

*   Is this information potentially valuable to others in the future?
*   Would editing the post be sufficient instead of deleting it entirely?
*   If the discussion contains important context or decisions, consider keeping it for historical reference.

If the post contains sensitive information that must be removed, deletion is appropriate.
