## Reviewer responsibilities

Based on our Blueprint framework, the reviewer:

**Acknowledges check-ins** — Must explicitly acknowledge each monthly check-in from the champion by clicking **Acknowledge this Check-In**.

**Provides guidance** — Gives feedback and direction throughout the goal's lifecycle.

**Initiates corrective action** — Has authority to step in if the goal is off track.

**Approves completion** — Reviews and approves when the goal is ready to be closed.

## Choosing a reviewer

**Typically the champion's manager** — The person to whom the champion reports.

**Has oversight authority** — Someone who can provide guidance and make decisions.

**Understands the context** — Familiar with the goal's purpose and constraints.

## Managing reviewer assignments

You can change reviewers at any time by clicking **Set reviewer** again. The reviewer typically has a broader view of multiple goals and can help ensure alignment across work.
