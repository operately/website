Anyone in the organization can create a new [space](/help/intro-to-spaces).

To create a new space:

<Steps>
1. Go to your organization Home.
2. On the right, above the grid of spaces, click **Add Space** button.
3. Enter a name for the space.
4. Write the purpose of the team or department.
5. Set the company-wide access level for the space:
   - **No Access** makes the space secret (only explicitly granted members can access it).
   - **View**, **Comment**, **Edit**, or **Full Access** define baseline access for company members.
6. Click **Create Space**.
</Steps>

For more information on space permissions, see [How permissions work](/help/permissions-overview) and [Space access control](/help/space-access-control).
