import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

To see everyone who has access to your [space](/help/intro-to-spaces):

<Steps>
1. Go to your space
2. Click the **Manage access** button next to the member avatars
</Steps>

You'll see four groups of people:

- **Space Managers** - People with full management access
- **Members** - People explicitly added to the space
- **Other People with Access** - People who have access through company settings
- **General Access** - Shows if everyone in your company has access

Each person's current [access level](/help/space-access-control) is shown next to their name.

<Aside type="note">
The **Manage access** button is only visible to members with Full Access to the space.
</Aside>
