2/ Select **Switch Company** from the dropdown menu.

3/ This takes you to the Lobby screen where you can see all organizations you belong to.

4/ Click on the organization you want to access.

5/ You'll immediately be switched to that organization's workspace.


## Working in multiple organizations

When you switch to a different organization:

- Your notifications, spaces, and content will change to show only what's relevant to that organization
- Your personal account settings remain the same across all organizations

If you need to reference information across organizations, you can open Operately in different browser tabs, each logged into a different organization.
