2. Click **Resume project** in the Actions section of the sidebar

## After resuming a project

- **Project status changes**: The project will be marked as active and moved back to the "All work" and "Projects" tabs in Work Maps
- **Timeline preservation**: All milestones, tasks, and deadlines remain exactly as they were before pausing
- **Team notifications**: Project contributors will be notified about the resumption
- **Check-in restoration**: The project champion will resume receiving check-in requests
