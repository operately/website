People with direct access to a goal can view and interact with it based on their access level. Managing access effectively ensures the right people can contribute to your goal's success.

## How to manage access

<Steps>
1. Open the goal page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, click on **Manage access**
3. On the new page, in the **People with Direct Access** section, you'll see everyone with direct access to the goal
</Steps>

### Adding people

<Steps>
1. Click the **Add People** button at the top of the page
2. Select a company member from the dropdown
3. Choose the appropriate access level for the person
4. To add multiple people at once, click the **+** button and repeat steps 2-3
5. Once you've selected all new people, click **Add people**
</Steps>

### Removing people

<Steps>
1. Find the person you want to remove in the People with Direct Access section
2. Click on the three dots (**...**) next to their name
3. Select **Remove from goal** from the dropdown menu
</Steps>

## After updating access

Once you've made changes to the access list, new people gain goal access and removed people lose access.

## Best practices for access management

- **Appropriate access levels** - Grant the minimum access level necessary for people to do their work
- **Regular reviews** - Periodically review the access list to ensure it's up to date
- **Communication** - Inform the team when access is granted or revoked
- **Documentation** - Keep track of why people were given access and their expected involvement
