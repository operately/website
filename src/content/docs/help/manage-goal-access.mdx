## How direct access combines with baseline access

A person can receive goal access from multiple sources:

- Company-members baseline
- Space-members baseline
- Direct goal access

Operately uses the most permissive grant as effective access.

For the full model and level definitions, see [How permissions work](/help/permissions-overview) and [Goal permissions](/help/set-goal-privacy).

<Aside type="tip">
Grant direct access only when someone needs a level that differs from baseline rules.
