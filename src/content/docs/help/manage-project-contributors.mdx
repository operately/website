## How contributor access combines with baseline access

A person can receive project access from:

- Company-members baseline
- Space-members baseline
- Contributor grant

Operately uses the most permissive grant as effective access.

## Important limitation

People with **Edit Access** can manage contributors, but they cannot grant contributor access above **Edit Access**.

For complete level definitions and project-wide rules, see [Project permissions](/help/project-access-control) and [How permissions work](/help/permissions-overview).

<Aside type="tip">
Use baseline rules for broad visibility and contributor grants for people who actively execute project work.
