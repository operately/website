Changing a project's parent goal helps you reorganize your work structure and ensure projects are aligned with the right business objectives.

## How to edit the parent goal

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, find the **Parent Goal** section
3. Click on the parent goal area (or current parent goal if one exists)
4. If the project already has a parent goal, click **Choose another goal**
5. Select a goal from the dropdown menu
6. Click **Save** to confirm the change
</Steps>

## Common reasons to change parent goals

You might need to update a project's parent goal when:

- Company priorities shift and the project now supports a different objective
- You realize the project fits better under another goal
- Goals get reorganized and you need to update the structure
- You created the project under the wrong goal initially

## What happens when you change it

Once updated, the project will:

- Appear under the new parent goal in [work maps](/help/work-map-overview)
- Maintain its existing tasks and milestones - only the organizational structure changes.

This keeps everything organized so you can easily see which projects support which goals.
