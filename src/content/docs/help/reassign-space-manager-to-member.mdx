To change a space manager's role to a regular member in your [space](/help/intro-to-spaces):

<Steps>
1. Go to your space
2. Click the **Manage access** button next to the member avatars
3. Find the manager in the **Space Managers** section
4. Click the menu (•••) next to their name
5. Select **Reassign to member**
</Steps>

When reassigning a manager to a member, they will lose their ability to manage the space, including team and access management capabilities.

The reassigned person will retain their current access level (Full Access or Limited Access) as a regular member. You can adjust their access level separately if needed. See [Space Access Control](/help/space-access-control) for more information.

<Aside type="note">
Only space managers with Full Access can change other managers' roles.
