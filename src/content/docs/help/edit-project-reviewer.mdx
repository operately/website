Changing a project's reviewer helps ensure the right person is providing oversight and quality assurance for the project's deliverables.

## How to edit the reviewer

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, find the **Reviewer** section
3. Click on the reviewer area:
   - If a reviewer is already assigned, click on their name and select **Choose someone else**
   - If no reviewer is assigned, click on the empty area
4. Select a new reviewer from the dropdown list of team members
</Steps>

## When to change reviewers

Consider updating a project's reviewer when:

- **Expertise requirements** - The project needs review from someone with specific domain knowledge
- **Availability changes** - The current reviewer is no longer available or overcommitted
- **Quality standards** - Different review standards or processes are needed
- **Conflict resolution** - Avoiding potential conflicts of interest in the review process

Having the right reviewer ensures quality oversight and helps maintain project standards throughout development.
