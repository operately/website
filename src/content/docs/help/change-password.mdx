If you know your current Operately password and want to change it for security reasons or personal preference, follow these steps while logged in.

<Steps>
1. Click on your avatar or initials in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Select **My Account** from the dropdown menu.
3. Click on **Password & Security** in the account settings menu.
4. Click the **Change your password** link.
5. On the Change Password form, enter your **Current Password**.
6. Enter your desired **New Password** (must be at least 12 characters).
7. **Confirm New Password** by entering it again.
8. Click the **Change Password** button to save your new password.
</Steps>

Your password will be updated immediately.

**Note:** If you use Google to sign in, you manage your password through your Google account, not Operately.
