## Important notes

*   You can only edit your own posts and comments.
*   While there is no visible edit history to other users, it's good practice to indicate significant changes (e.g., by adding "Edit:" before new information).
*   If you need to make extensive changes to a discussion, consider whether starting a new, clearer discussion might be better.
