Removing a trusted email domain prevents users with email addresses from that domain from automatically signing up for your organization. Existing users from that domain will retain access, but new sign-ups will require a manual invitation.

## Who can manage trusted domains?

Only account owners can add or remove trusted email domains.

## How to remove a trusted email domain

<Steps>
1.  Click on your organization name in the top navigation bar to open the company menu.
2.  Select **Company Admin** from the dropdown menu.
3.  Under the "As an owner, you can:" section, click **Manage trusted email domains**.
4.  On the "Trusted Email Domains" page, find the domain you wish to remove in the "Trusted Email Domains" list.
5.  Click the **trash icon** next to the domain name.
</Steps>

The domain will be immediately removed from the trusted list. New users from this domain will no longer be able to sign up automatically.
