A good project description provides context and clarity for your team. It explains what needs to be done, what deliverables are expected, and any important constraints or considerations.

**Note:** Not having a description is absolutely fine in many cases, especially for straightforward projects with clear scope where the milestones and tasks tell the whole story.

## Adding a project description

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. Right above the **Milestones** section, click the **Add a project description...** text
3. Use the rich text editor to write your description
4. Click **Save** to add the description to your project
</Steps>

## What to include in your description

A good project description provides context for your team. Consider including:

**Context**: Background information and any related previous work.

**Problem & solution**: What challenge you're solving and your proposed approach.

**Outcomes**: What immediate results you expect to achieve, especially any customer impact.

**Resources needed**: Team members, budget, or other requirements.

**Risks**: Potential challenges and how you plan to address them.

## Using the rich text editor

The project description editor provides formatting options to help you organize your content. For detailed information about using the rich text editor, see [Format text and embed images](/help/format-document-text).

**Update as needed**: As the project evolves, update the description to reflect new understanding or changed circumstances.
