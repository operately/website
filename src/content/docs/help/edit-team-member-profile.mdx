Administrators can help keep the organization's information accurate by updating the profile details of team members when necessary.

## Who can edit team member profiles?

Only account owners and administrators have the permission to edit other team members' profiles.

## How to edit a team member's profile

<Steps>
1.  Click on your organization name in the top navigation bar to open the company menu.
2.  Select **Company Admin** from the dropdown menu.
3.  Navigate to the **Manage Team Members** section.
4.  Find the person whose profile you want to edit in the **Current Team Members** list.
5.  Click the **Edit Profile** button next to their name. (Alternatively, click the **...** menu and select **View Profile**).
6.  This will open the team member's profile page.
</Steps>

## What information can be edited?

On the team member's profile page, you can update the following:

-   **Name:** The team member's full name.
-   **Title in Company:** Their job title.
-   **Timezone:** Their local timezone. Setting this correctly ensures timestamps display accurately for them.
-   **Who is their manager?:** Assign their direct manager for the organization chart. This is crucial for maintaining an accurate [company org chart](/help/view-company-org-chart).

These are the same fields the team member can edit themselves in their own [profile settings](/help/fill-in-personal-info).

## Saving the changes

After making the necessary updates, click the **Save Changes** button.

The team member's profile information will be updated immediately.
