The champion is the person accountable for driving the goal forward. They own the goal's success and provide regular updates on progress.

## Assigning a champion

<Steps>
1. Open the goal page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, find the **Champion** section
3. Click **Set champion** to open the team member selector
4. Search for and select the appropriate team member
</Steps>

## Key considerations

**Expertise** — Choose someone with the knowledge and skills needed to drive the goal forward.

**Capacity** — Ensure they have the time and bandwidth to take on this responsibility.

**Influence** — The champion should have the authority or relationships needed to make things happen.

## Champion responsibilities

Based on our Blueprint framework, the champion is:

**Ultimately responsible** for achieving the goal and accountable for providing regular progress updates (typically monthly for quarterly goals).

**The single owner** — Each goal has one champion to avoid ambiguity in accountability.

**The decision maker** — They plan, assign responsibilities, and lead by example.

## Managing assignments

You can change champions at any time by clicking **Set champion** again. One person can champion multiple goals, but be mindful of their capacity.

The champion typically reports to the reviewer, who provides oversight and guidance throughout the goal's lifecycle.
