Deleting a project permanently removes it from Operately. This action cannot be undone, so use it carefully.

## Deleting a project

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, click **Delete**
3. Review the warning message about permanent deletion
4. Click **Delete Forever** to confirm
</Steps>

## What gets deleted

**Project details** — All descriptions, milestones, tasks, and settings.

**Progress history** — All check-ins, updates, and progress data.

**Discussions** — All comments and conversations related to the project.

**Activity** — All activity records and audit trails.

**Resources** — All attached files, links, and documents.

**Contributors** — All contributor assignments and permissions.

## When to delete vs. close

**Delete** — Use when a project was created by mistake, is completely irrelevant, or contains sensitive information that needs to be permanently removed.

**Close** — Use when a project is complete or no longer relevant but you want to preserve the history and insights.

## Considerations before deleting

**Impact on other work** — Check if the project is linked to parent goals or has dependencies that might be affected.

**Team communication** — Let relevant team members and contributors know about the deletion.

**Data preservation** — Export any important information, documents, or resources before deleting.

**Alternative approaches** — Consider closing the project instead to preserve history and learnings.

## Recovery

Once a project is deleted, it cannot be recovered. The deletion is permanent and affects all users who had access to the project.
