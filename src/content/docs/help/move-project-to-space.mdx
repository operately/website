Moving a project to another space allows you to reorganize your projects and ensure they're in the most appropriate workspace for your team structure.

## How to move a project to another space

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. Click on **Move to another space** in the Actions section of the sidebar
3. **Select the destination space** from the dropdown menu
4. Click **Move** to confirm the action
</Steps>

## After moving the project

- **Access permissions**: Effective access is recalculated from destination-space context, project baseline permissions, and contributor grants. People may gain or lose access.
- **Notifications**: Team members will be notified about the project move
- **Project history**: All project data, milestones, tasks, and history will be preserved during the move

## When to move a project to another space

- **Project scope changes**: When a project's focus shifts and it becomes more relevant to a different space
- **Access control**: When you need to change who has access to the project by moving it to a space with different permissions
- **Better organization**: When you realize a project would be better organized under a different space's theme or purpose
