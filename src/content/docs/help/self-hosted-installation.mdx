This guide walks you through downloading and installing Operately on your own infrastructure.

## Pre-requisites

### Select a server

Choose a machine to host Operately. For cloud hosting, we recommend
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), or
[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/).

Minimum requirements:

- 2GB RAM and 1 CPU (suitable for teams up to 30 people)
- 8GB RAM and 4 CPUs (recommended for larger teams)

### Configure a domain for your server

Point a domain to your server. You can use a subdomain (e.g. `operately.example.com`) or a
root domain (e.g. `example.com`). Configure the DNS records to point to your server's IP
address. Make sure it's a direct DNS pointer, not a proxy (e.g. avoid Cloudflare proxy).

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

Operately runs as a set of Docker containers orchestrated by Docker Compose.
Install Docker and Docker Compose for your operating system:

- [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Set up a mail server

Operately supports email delivery via SendGrid or SMTP.

- **SendGrid:** Create a SendGrid account and generate an API key by following
  the [SendGrid documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/).
- **SMTP:** To use SMTP with providers like AWS SES, Gmail, Mailgun, or others,
  refer to the [SMTP configuration documentation](https://github.com/operately/operately/blob/main/docs/smtp-configuration.md).

## Installation steps

### Download the latest release of Operately

Download and extract the latest Operately release:

```bash
wget -q https://github.com/operately/operately/releases/latest/download/operately-single-host.tar.gz
tar -xf operately-single-host.tar.gz
cd operately
```

### Run the installation script

Run the installation script to configure Operately:

```bash
./install.sh
```

The script will:

- Build the Docker images
- Configure the environment
- Set up a Let's encrypt certificate
- Prompt you for the following information:
  - _Domain_: The domain for your server (e.g. `operately.example.com`)
  - _Admin email_: The email address for receiving Let's Encrypt notifications
  - _Email configuration_: Either SendGrid API key or SMPT server details.

### Launch Operately

Start Operately using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --wait --detach
```

Operately should now be running on your server. You can access it by navigating to your
configured domain (e.g. `https://operately.example.com`).
