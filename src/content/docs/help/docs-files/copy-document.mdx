You can copy a document to create a new version or to share with others. When you copy a 
document, you create a new document with the same content as the original document. 
You can then edit the new document without affecting the original document.

To copy a document:

<Steps>
1. Open the document you want to copy.
2. Click on the "..." menu in the top right corner.
3. Select **Copy** from the dropdown menu.
4. Choose where you want to save the new document.
5. Click **Copy** to create the new document.
</Steps>

Members of the space will be notified that a new document was added. 

### Use documents as templates

You can use documents as templates to save time when creating new documents. For example, 
you can create a template for meeting notes, project plans, or reports. Then, you can copy 
the template each time you need to create a new document.
