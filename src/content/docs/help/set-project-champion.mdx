Setting a project's champion helps ensure the right person is leading and taking ownership of the project's success.

## How to edit the champion

<Steps>
1. Open the project page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, find the **Champion** section
3. Click on the champion area:
   - If a champion is already assigned, click on their name and select **Choose someone else**
   - If no champion is assigned, click on the empty area
4. Select a new champion from the dropdown list of team members
</Steps>

## When to change champions

Having the right champion ensures effective project leadership and accountability throughout the project lifecycle. Consider updating a project's champion when:

- The current champion has moved to a different role or team
- The champion is overloaded and needs to delegate
- Someone with more relevant skills becomes available
- Providing leadership opportunities to team members
