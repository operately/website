Moving a goal to another space changes which team or department owns it. This is useful when work scope changes or when goals need to be reorganized.

## Moving a goal

<Steps>
1. Open the goal page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the sidebar, click **Move to another space**
3. Select the destination space from the dropdown
4. Click **Move** to complete the transfer
</Steps>

## When to move goals

**Scope changes** — The goal's focus has shifted to a different team or department.

**Reorganization** — Company structure changes require moving work between spaces.

**Better ownership** — Another team is better suited to drive the goal forward.

**Resource allocation** — Moving the goal to a team with more capacity or expertise.

## What happens when you move

**Ownership transfers** — The goal becomes part of the destination space.

**Access changes** — Space members of the new space get edit access, while company members retain comment access.

**Notifications** — Team members in the new space will be notified about the goal.

**History preserved** — All goal history, discussions, and progress remain intact.

## Considerations

**Team alignment** — Ensure the new space has the right expertise and capacity.

**Communication** — Let relevant stakeholders know about the move.

**Dependencies** — Consider how the move affects related goals or projects.

**Timing** — Move goals when they're in early stages to minimize disruption.
