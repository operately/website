Targets are the measurable outcomes that define success for your goal. Unlike traditional progress tracking that relies on subjective estimates, targets give you concrete metrics to track real progress.

## Adding a target

<Steps>
1. Open the goal page and go to the **Overview** tab
2. In the **Targets** section, click the **Add** button
3. Fill in the target details and click **Add Target**
</Steps>

## Target details to provide

Each target requires four pieces of information:

**Name** — A clear description of what you're measuring. Examples: "Increase monthly signup count" or "Reduce customer churn rate"

**Start value** — The current baseline. This is where you are now. Example: "10000" users

**Target value** — Where you want to end up. This is your goal. Example: "15000" users

**Unit** — What you're measuring. Examples: "users", "dollars", "percentage", "customers"

## Examples of good targets

**Quantitative metrics** — "Increase monthly revenue from $50K to $75K"

**Time-based targets** — "Complete user research by end of Q2"

**Quality indicators** — "Achieve customer satisfaction score above 4.5"

**Process improvements** — "Reduce support ticket resolution time from 24 hours to 4 hours"

**Adoption metrics** — "Increase feature usage from 30% to 60% of active users"

## Updating target progress

Once you've created targets, you can update their progress:

<Steps>
1. In the **Targets** section, click the **Update** button next to any target
2. Enter the new current value
3. Click **Save** to update the progress
</Steps>

The system automatically calculates progress as a percentage based on your start and target values. You can also expand targets to see detailed progress information and edit or delete them as needed.

## Tips for effective targets

**Make them specific** — "Increase user retention" is vague. "Increase 30-day retention from 60% to 75%" is specific.

**Ensure they're measurable** — You should be able to track progress with real data, not subjective assessments.

**Set realistic but challenging values** — Targets should stretch your team but remain achievable.

**Include timeframes** — When possible, specify when you expect to reach the target.

**Focus on outcomes** — Measure results, not just activities. "Launch new feature" is an activity. "10,000 users adopt new feature" is an outcome.

**Limit the number** — Too many targets can be overwhelming. Focus on 3-5 key metrics that matter most.

Targets transform vague goals into concrete, trackable outcomes. They help you celebrate progress, identify problems early, and stay focused on what really matters.
