The Assigned tab shows all the goals and projects you're responsible for. This is your daily dashboard — the work that needs your attention right now.

## What you'll see in the Assigned tab

The Assigned tab displays your active work in a table format, showing:

- **Name** — The title of the goal or project, with an icon indicating whether it's a goal (target icon) or project (document icon)
- **Status** — Current state (On Track, At Risk, Off Track, etc.)
- **Progress** — Visual bar showing completion percentage
- **Due Date** — When the work should be finished
- **Space** — Which team or department owns the work
- **Champion** — The person responsible (usually you, or a co-champion)
- **Next Step** — The immediate action needed to move forward

## Managing your assigned work

This tab helps you prioritize and stay on top of your commitments. You can:

- **Click on any goal or project name** to open its detailed page where you can update progress, add milestones, or start discussions
- **Click on the space name** to see all work happening in that team
- **Click on the champion's name** to view their profile and see all their work
- **Use the status and progress indicators** to quickly spot what needs attention

## When to use the Assigned tab

**Daily planning** — Start your day by reviewing what's assigned to you and what needs immediate attention.

**Weekly reviews** — Use this view to prepare for team meetings or 1:1s with your manager.

**Priority management** — The status and due date columns help you identify what's urgent or at risk.

**Progress tracking** — The progress bars give you a quick visual sense of how your work is advancing.

<Aside>The Assigned tab only shows active work. Completed goals and projects move to the Completed tab, giving you a clean view of what's currently on your plate.</Aside>

## Tips for staying organized

- **Check this tab regularly** — It's your primary dashboard for active work
- **Use the status indicators** — Red or yellow status items need your attention
- **Review due dates** — Items with approaching deadlines should be prioritized
- **Update progress** — Regular updates keep your work visible to others and help you track momentum

The Assigned tab keeps your active work front and center, so you never lose track of what you're responsible for.
