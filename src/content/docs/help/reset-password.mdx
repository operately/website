If you use an email and password to log in to Operately and can't remember your password, you can request a reset link.

<Steps>
1. Go to the Operately [Log In page](/help/log-in).
2. Click the **Forgot Password?** link below the login form.
3. Enter the email address associated with your Operately account.
4. Click the **Send Reset Instructions** button.
5. Check your email inbox for a message from Operately with password reset instructions.
6. Follow the link in the email to create a new password.
</Steps>

**Note:** If you sign in using Google, you'll need to manage your password through your Google account settings, not through this reset process.
