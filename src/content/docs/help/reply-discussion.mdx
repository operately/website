Replying to discussions allows you to contribute to conversations, ask questions, and share information with your team in an organized way.

## How to comment on a discussion

<Steps>
1.  Navigate to the discussion you want to reply to.
2.  Scroll to the bottom of the discussion where you'll find a comment box with your profile picture and a **Write a comment here...** placeholder.
3.  Click in this area to begin writing your comment.
4.  Use the formatting toolbar to add styling, lists, or links to your comment if needed.
5.  When you're finished composing your reply, click the **Post** button.
</Steps>

Your comment will appear in the discussion thread, and subscribers to the discussion will be notified.

## Subscribing to discussions

When you comment on a discussion, you are automatically subscribed to it and will receive notifications when others comment. You'll see a "You're subscribed" indicator beneath the comment area.

If you want to stop receiving notifications:
*   Click the **Unsubscribe me** button below the comment area.

If you want to receive notifications without commenting:
*   Look for the "Subscribers" section below the comment area.
*   Click **Add/remove people...** to add yourself or others.

## Formatting your replies

Comments support the same formatting options as the main discussion post. You can:
*   Use basic text formatting (headers, bold, italic, strikethrough)
*   Create bulleted or numbered lists
*   Add links
*   Embed images, videos, and documents
*   Include code snippets

See [Format text and embed images](/help/format-document-text) for more details on using the formatting tools.
